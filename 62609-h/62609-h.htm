<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">While</span> following the occupation of a locomotive
engineer, I often observed peculiarities about the
working of my engine, while running, that I did not
entirely understand. As I was perfectly aware, even
before making my first trip on a locomotive engine,
that there is no effect without a cause, I never felt
satisfied to accept any thing as incomprehensible
without investigation, and fell into the habit of noting
down facts about the working of the engine, with the
view of studying out, at leisure, any thing which was
not quite clear. When, some years ago, I abandoned
engine-running to take charge of the round-house at
the mechanical headquarters of the Burlington, Cedar
Rapids, and Northern Railway, in Iowa, the practice
of keeping notes was continued. The work connected
with the ordinary repairing of running-engines, the
emergency repairing executed to get engines ready
hurriedly to meet the traffic demands on a road then
chronically short of power, and diagnosing the numerous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>iv</span>
diseases that locomotives are heir to, provided
ample material for voluminous notes. Those notes
formed the raw material from which this book was
constructed.</p>

<p>The original intention was, to publish a book on
Locomotive Engine Running alone, and the first portion
of the work was prepared with that idea in view;
but, before the articles were finished, I joined the
editorial staff of the <i>American Machinist</i>. The correspondence
in the office of that paper convinced me
that an urgent demand existed, among engineers, machinists,
and others, for plainly given information
relating to numerous operations connected with the
repairing and maintenance of locomotives. To meet
this demand, the chapters on “Valve-Motion” and all
the succeeding part of the book were written. Most
of that matter was originally written for the pages of
the <i>American Machinist</i>, but was afterwards re-arranged
for the book.</p>

<p>In preparing a book for the use of engineers, firemen,
machinists, and others interested in locomotive
matters, it has been my aim to treat all subjects discussed
in such a way that any reader would easily
understand every sentence written. No attempt is
made to convey instruction in any thing beyond elementary
problems in mechanical engineering, and all
problems brought forward are treated in the simplest
manner possible.</p>

<p>The practice of applying to books for information<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>v</span>
concerning their work, is rapidly spreading among the
engineers and mechanics of this school-spangled country;
and this book is published in the hope that its
pages may furnish a share of the needed assistance.
Those men, who, Socrates-like, search for knowledge
from the recorded experience of others, are the men,
who, in the near future, will take leading places in
our march of national progress. To such men, who
are earnestly toiling up the steep grade of Self-help,
this book is respectfully dedicated.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">I desire</span> to thank the railroad world and the technical
press for the kind reception they have extended
to my book. The necessity for publishing the third
edition within three months after the first one was

<p>In the present edition I have corrected a few errors,
and made some necessary alterations, that will add to
the value of the book.</p>

<h3>ATTRIBUTES THAT MAKE A GOOD ENGINEER.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> locomotive engine which reaches nearest perfection,
is one which performs the greatest amount of
work at the least cost for fuel, lubricants, wear and tear
of machinery, and of the track traversed: the nearest
approach to perfection in an engineer, is the man who
can work the engine so as to develop its best capabilities
at the least cost. Poets are said to be born, not
made. The same may be said of engineers. One man
may have charge of an engine for only a few months,
and yet exhibit thorough knowledge of his business,
displaying sagacity resembling instinct concerning the
treatment necessary to secure the best performance
from his engine: another man, who appears equally
intelligent in matters not pertaining to the locomotive,
never develops a thorough understanding of the machine.</p>

<h3>HOW ENGINEERING KNOWLEDGE AND SKILL ARE ACQUIRED.</h3>

<p>A man who possesses the natural gifts necessary for
the making of a good engineer, will advance more rapidly
in acquiring mastery of the business than does one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>2</span>
whom Nature intended for a ditcher. But there is no
royal road to the knowledge requisite for making a first-class
engineer. The capability of handling an engine
can be acquired by a few months’ practice. Opening
the throttle, and moving the reverse lever, require but
scanty skill; there is no great accomplishment in being
able to pack a gland, or tighten up a loose nut; but the
magazine of practical knowledge, which enables an
engineer to meet every emergency with calmness and
promptitude, is obtained only by years of experience
on the footboard, and by assiduous observation while
there.</p>

<h3>PUBLIC INTEREST IN LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS.</h3>

<p>Ever since the incipiency of the railroad system,
a close interest has been manifested by the general
public in the character and capabilities of locomotive
engineers. This is natural, for no other class of men
hold the safe-keeping of so much life and property in
their hands.</p>

<h3>IGNORANCE VERSUS KNOWLEDGE.</h3>

<p>Two leading pioneers of railway progress in Europe
took diametrically opposite views of the intellectual
qualities best calculated to make a good engineer.
George Stephenson preferred intelligent men, well educated
and read up in mechanical and physical science;
Brunel recommended illiterate men for taking charge
of engines, on the novel hypothesis, that, having nothing
else in their heads, there would be abundant room
for the acquirement of knowledge respecting their
work. In every test of skill, the intelligent men proved
victors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>3</span></p>

<h3>ILLITERATE ENGINEERS NOT WANTED IN AMERICA.</h3>

<p>No demand for illiterate or ignorant engineers has
ever arisen in America. Many men who have spent
an important portion of their lives on the footboard,
have risen to grace the highest ranks of the mechanical
and social world. The pioneer engines, which demonstrated
the successful working of locomotive power,
were run by some of the most accomplished mechanical
engineers in the country. As an engine adapted to the
work it has to perform, the American locomotive is
recognized to have always kept ahead of its compeers
in other parts of the world. No inconsiderable part of
this superiority is due to the fact, that nearly all the
master mechanics who control the designing of our
locomotives have had experience in running them, and
thereby understand exactly the qualities most needed
for the work to be done.</p>

<h3>GROWING IMPORTANCE OF ENGINEERS’ DUTIES.</h3>

<p>The safe and punctual operation of our railroads has
always depended to a great extent upon the discriminating
care of the engineer. The present tendency of
railroad operating is to increase his responsibility.
Every advance in brake improvement increases the
duties of the enginemen, and upon them will soon
devolve the entire management and control of trains
while in motion.</p>

<h3>INDIVIDUALITY OF AMERICAN ENGINEERS.</h3>

<p>Writing on the fitness of various railroad employés
for their duties, that eminent authority, Ex-Railroad-Commissioner
Charles F. Adams, jun., says, “In discussing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>4</span>
and comparing the appliances used in the practical
operating of railroads in different countries, there
is one element, however, which can never be left out
of the account. The intelligence, quickness of perception,
and capacity for taking care of themselves,—that
combination of qualities, which, taken together, constitute
individuality, and adaptability to circumstances,—vary
greatly among the railroad employés of different
countries. The American locomotive engineer, as he
is called, is especially gifted in this way. He can be
relied on to take care of himself and his train under circumstances
which in other countries would be thought
to insure disaster.”</p>

<h3>NECESSITY FOR CLASS IMPROVEMENT.</h3>

<p>While American locomotive engineers can confidently
invite comparison between their own mechanical and
intellectual attainments and those of their compeers
in any nation under the sun, there still remains ample
room for improvement. If they are not advancing, they
are retrograding. The engineer who looks back to
companions of a generation ago, and says that we know
as much as they did, but no more, implies the assertion
that his class is going backward. On very few roads,
and in but rare instances, can this grave charge be
made, that the engineers are falling behind in the
intellectual race. On the contrary, there are signs all
around us of substantial work in the cause of intellectual
and moral advancement.</p>

<h3>THE SKILL OF ENGINEERS INFLUENCES OPERATING EXPENSES.</h3>

<p>No class of railroad-men affects the expenses of operating
so directly as engineers do. The daily wages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>5</span>
paid to an engineer is a trifling sum compared to the
amount he can save or waste by good or bad management
of his engine. Fuel wasted, lubricants thrown
away, supplies destroyed, and machinery abused, leading
to extravagant running repairs, make up a long bill by
the end of each month, where enginemen are incompetent.
Every man with any spark of manliness in his
breast will strive to become master of his work; and,
stirred by this ambition, he will avoid wasting the material
of his employer just as zealously as if the stores
were his own property; and only such men deserve a
position on the footboard.</p>

<p>The day has passed away when an engineer was
regarded as perfectly competent so long as he could
take his train over the road on time. Nowadays a
man must get the train along on schedule time to be
tolerated at all, and he is not considered a first-class
engineer unless he possesses the knowledge which enables
him to take the greatest amount of work out of the
engine with the least possible expense. To accomplish
such results, a thorough acquaintance with all
details of the engine is essential, so that the entire
machine may be operated as a harmonious unit, without
jar or pound: the various methods of economizing
heat must be intimately understood, and the laws which
govern combustion should be well known so far as they
apply to the management of the fire.</p>

<h3>METHODS OF SELF-IMPROVEMENT.</h3>

<p>To obtain this knowledge, which gives power, and
directly increases a man’s intrinsic value, young engineers
and aspiring firemen must devote a portion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>6</span>
of their leisure time to the form of self-improvement
relating to the locomotive. Socrates, a sagacious old
Greek philosopher, believed that the easiest way to
obtain knowledge was by persistently asking questions.
Young engineers can turn this system to good account.
Never feel ashamed to ask for information where it is
needed, and do not imagine that a man has reached the
limit of mechanical knowledge when he knows how to
open and shut the throttle-valve. The more a man
progresses in studying out the philosophy of the locomotive
and its economical operation, the more he gets
convinced of his own limited knowledge. A young
engineer who seeks for knowledge by questioning his
elders must not feel discouraged at a rebuff. Men
who refuse to answer civilly questions asked by juniors
searching for information, are generally in the dark
themselves, and attempt by rudeness to conceal their
own ignorance.</p>

<h3>OBSERVING SHOP OPERATIONS.</h3>

<p>The system in vogue in most of our States, especially
in the West, of taking on men for firemen who have
received no previous mechanical training, leaves a wide
field open for engineering instruction. Such men can
not spend too much time watching the operations going
on in repair-shops; every detail of round-house
work should be closely observed; the various parts of
the great machine they are learning to manage should
be studied in detail. No operation of repairs is too
trifling to receive strict attention. Where the machinists
are examining piston-packing, facing valves, reducing
rod-brasses, or lining down wedges, the ambitious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>7</span>
novice will, by close watching of the work, obtain
knowledge of the most useful kind. Looking on will
not teach him how to do the work, but interesting himself
in the procedure is a long step in the direction of
learning. Repairing of pumps and injectors is interesting
work, full of instructive points which may prove
invaluable on the road. The rough work performed by
the men who change truck-wheels, put new brasses in
oil-boxes, and replace broken springs, is worthy of close
attention; for it is just such work that enginemen are
most likely to be called upon to perform on the road in
cases of accident. To obtain a thorough insight into
the working of the locomotive, no detail of its construction
is too trifling for attention. The unison of the
aggregate machine depends upon the harmonious adjustment
of the various parts; and, unless a man understands
the connection of the details, he is never likely
to become skillful in detecting derangements.</p>

<h3>WHERE IGNORANCE WAS RUIN.</h3>

<p>I knew a case where the neglect to learn how minor
work about the engine was done, proved fatal to the
prospects of a young engineer. A new engine-truck
box had been adopted shortly before he went running;
and, although he had often seen the cellar taken down
by the round-house men when they were packing the
trucks, he never paid close attention to how it was
done. As the new plan was a radical change from the
old practice, taking down the new cellar was a little
puzzling at first to a man who did not know how to do
it. One day this young engineer took out an engine
with the new kind of truck, and a journal got running<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>8</span>
hot. He crept under the truck among snow and slush,
to take the cellar down for packing; but he struggled
half an hour over it, and could not get the thing down.
Then the conductor came along, to see what was the
matter; and, being posted on such work, he perceived
that the young engineer did not know how to take the
cellar out of the box. The conductor helped the engineer
to do a job he should have needed no assistance
with. The story was presently carried to headquarters
with additions, and was the means of returning the
young engineer to the left-hand side.</p>

<h3>PREJUDICE AGAINST STUDYING BOOKS.</h3>

<p>There is a silly prejudice in some quarters against
engineers applying to books for information respecting
their engines. Engineers are numerous who boast
noisily that all their knowledge is derived from actual
experience, and they despise theorists who study books,
drawings, or models in acquiring particulars concerning
the construction or operation of the locomotive parts.
Such men have nothing to boast of. They never learn
much, because ignorant egotism keeps them blind. They
keep the ranks of the mere stopper and starter well
filled.</p>

<h3>THE KIND OF KNOWLEDGE GAINED FROM BOOKS.</h3>

<p>The books on mechanical practice which these ultra
practical men despise, contain in condensed form the
experience and discoveries that have been gleaned
from the hardest workers and thinkers of past ages.
The product of long years of toilful experiment, where
intense thought has furrowed expansive brows, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>9</span>
weary watching has whitened raven locks, is often recorded
on a few pages. A mechanical fact which an
experimenter has spent years in discovering and elucidating,
can be learned and tested by a student in as
many hours. The man who despises book-knowledge
relating to any calling or profession, rejects the wisdom
begotten of former recorded labor.</p>

<p>A careful perusal of <i>Forney’s Catechism of the Locomotive</i>
will teach the young engineer valuable lessons
about his engine which can be daily substantiated by
practice. In nearly every instance, reading such a work
acts as a stimulant to the perceptive faculties of an
engineer. An explanation of a point helps to throw
new light on something that was hazy, but now appears
perfectly clear. An assertion made that a man does
not agree with provokes thought, and thought leads to
investigation. A writer may continually present matters
at variance with the views of a reader, and yet be
the means of imparting valuable knowledge. When
an engineer wishes to gain a thorough knowledge of
the valve-motion,—and most of us pride ourselves on
what we know about this subject,—he may go in for a
systematic study of Auchincloss on <i>Link and Valve
Motions</i>. Here he will obtain information that can
never be reached by mere practice with the actual
motion; yet access to, and observation of, the working-motion,
will engrave the principles upon his memory so
that they can never be forgotten. <i>Porter on the Indicator</i>
is a good source from whence accurate knowledge
respecting the expansive working of steam can be obtained.
Many other springs of knowledge flow clear
and free. What is needed is the inclination to receive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>10</span>
and the determination to obtain. When a man is
searching honestly for information upon mechanical
subjects, he will quickly find means of gratifying his
desire.</p>

<h3>RELIABLE MEN NEEDED TO RUN LOCOMOTIVES.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Locomotive</span> engine running is one of the most
modern of trades, consequently its acquirement has not
been controlled by the exact methods associated with
ancient guild apprenticeships. Nevertheless, graduates
to this business do not take charge of the iron horse
without the full meed of experience and skill requisite
for performing their duties successfully. The man who
runs a locomotive engine on our crowded railroads has
so much valuable property, directly and indirectly,
under his care, so much of life and limb depending
upon his skill and ability, that railroad companies are
not likely to intrust the position to those with a suspicion
of incompetency resting upon them.</p>

<h3>EARLY METHODS OF MAKING LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS.</h3>

<p>The prevailing methods of raising locomotive engineers
have been evolved from experience with the kind
of men best adapted to fill the position. In the early
days of the railroad world, when such men as George
Stephenson, Horatio Allen, John B. Jervis, Ross Winans,
and other pioneer engineers, demonstrated the successful
operation of the locomotive, they usually turned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>12</span>
over the care of their engines to the men who had assisted
in constructing the machines, or in putting them
together. This was the best that could be done at the
time; and the men selected generally proved competent
for the trust reposed in them; but it gave rise to a belief
that no man could run a locomotive successfully
unless he were a machinist. The possession of mechanical
skill necessary for making repairs was considered
the best recommendation for an engineer. Under this
system, all that a machinist was required to do,—so
that he could graduate as a full-fledged engineer,—was
to practice moving engines round in the yard for a few
days, when he was reported ready for the road. Akin
to this sentiment was that which recommended youths
of natural mechanical ability for the position of locomotive
engineer without subjecting them to any previous
special training. Graduates from mechanical institutes
were deemed capable of running an engine as soon as
they were perfectly certain about how to start and stop
the machine. The late Alexander L. Holley used to
relate an anecdote of this kind of an engineer. During
a severe winter storm, the train Holley was traveling
on got firmly stalled in a snow-bank. In its struggles
with the frozen elements, the engine got short of water;
and Holley found the engineer trying to fill the boiler
by shoveling snow down the smoke-stack!</p>

<h3>PRACTICE OF RAISING ENGINEERS FROM MACHINISTS AND TECHNICAL-SCHOOL
GRADUATES NOT FOUND SATISFACTORY.</h3>

<p>But it came to pass that more light in the matter of
engine-running dawned upon the minds of railroad
managers. They discovered that expertness in effecting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>13</span>
repairs on locomotives was not so essential in an
engineer as was the less pretentious ability of working
the engine so that the train would be pulled over the
road safely and on time: they perceived but scanty
merit in inherited mechanical genius which did not inspire
a youth with sagacity enough to see that certain
destruction would befall the heating-surface when he
attempted to run without water in the boiler. Experience
demonstrated, that, to manage an engine on the
road so that its best work should be developed at the
least cost, certain traits of skill and training were necessary,
which were altogether different from the culture
that made a man smart at constructing or repairing
machinery. It was found that one man might be a good
machinist, and yet make no kind of a decent runner; a
second man would be equally expert in both capacities;
while a third man, who never could do a respectable job
with tools, developed into an excellent engineer. One
of the best millwrights I ever knew, a man who achieved
considerable celebrity for skill in his craft, became a
fireman with the ambition of becoming a locomotive
runner. He fired acceptably for two years, then was
promoted, but quickly found that he could not run an
engine, and acknowledged that to be the case by returning
to the left side. He was too nervous, and
lacked confidence in himself. Overweening egotism is
not an attractive feature in a man’s character; but,
every thing else being equal, it is the self-confident man
that makes the successful engineer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>14</span></p>

<h3>EXPERIENCE DEMONSTRATED THAT FIREMEN MADE THE BEST
ENGINEERS.</h3>

<p>The experiment of raising locomotive engineers from
machinists and mechanical empirics was the uncertain
groping in the dark for the right man to fill the right
place. When the search for pretentious men proved
unsatisfactory, the right men were found at hand, accumulating
the necessary experience on the fireman’s
side of the engine. Then it became a recognized fact,
that, to take hold and run an engine to advantage, a man
must learn the business by working as fireman. There
have been frequent cases of men becoming successful
locomotive engineers without any previous training as
firemen, but they were the exceptions that proved the
rule.</p>

<h3>DIFFICULTIES OF RUNNING LOCOMOTIVES AT NIGHT, AND DURING
BAD WEATHER.</h3>

<p>In the matter of speed alone, there is much to learn
before a man can safely run a locomotive. During daylight
a novice will generally be half out in estimating
speed; and his judgment is merely wild guess-work,
regulated more by the condition of the track than by
the velocity his train is reaching. On a smooth piece
of track, he thinks he is making twenty-five miles an
hour, when forty miles is about the correct speed: then
he strikes a rough portion of the road-bed, and concludes
he is tearing along at thirty miles an hour, when
he is scarcely reaching twenty miles; since the first
lurchy spot made him shut off twenty per cent of the
steam. At night the case is much worse, especially
when the weather proves unfavorable. On a wild,
stormy night, the accumulated experience of years on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>15</span>
the footboard, which trains a man to judge of speed by
sound of the revolving-wheels, and to locate his position
between stations from a tree, a shrub, a protruding
bank, or any other trifling object that would pass unnoticed
by a less cultivated eye, is all needed to aid an
engineer in working along with unvaried speed without
jolt or tumult. On such a night, a man strange to the
business can not work a locomotive, and exercise proper
control over its movements. He may place the reverse
lever-latch in a certain notch, and keep the steam on;
he can regulate the pump after a fashion, and watch
that the water shall not get too low in the boiler; he can
shut off in good season while approaching stations, and
blunder into each depot by repeatedly applying steam;
but he exerts no control over the train, knows nothing
of what the engine is doing, and is constantly liable to
break the train in two. A diagram of his speed would
fluctuate as irregularly as the profile lines of a bluffy
country. This is where a machinist’s skill does not
apply to locomotive-running until it is supplemented by
an intimate knowledge of speed, of facility at handling
a train, and keeping the couplings intact, and of insight
into the best methods of economizing steam.</p>

<p>These are essentials which every man should possess
before he is put in charge of a locomotive on the road.
The great fund of practical knowledge which stamps
the first-class engineer, is amassed by general labor
during years of vigilant observation on the footboard,
amidst many changes of fair and foul weather.</p>

<p>As passing through the occupation of fireman was
the only way men could obtain practical knowledge of
engine-running before taking charge, railroad officials<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>16</span>
all over the world gradually fell into the way of regarding
that as the proper channel for men to traverse
before reaching the right-hand side of the locomotive.</p>

<h3>KIND OF MEN TO BE CHOSEN AS FIREMEN.</h3>

<p>As the pay for firemen rules moderately good, even
when compared with other skilled labor; and as the
higher position of engineer looms like a beacon not far
ahead,—there is always a liberal choice of good men
to begin work as firemen. Most railroad companies
recognize the importance of exercising judgment and
discretion in selecting the men who are to run as their
future engineers. Sobriety, industry, and intelligence
are essential attributes in a fireman who is going to
prove a success in his calling. Lack in any one of
these qualities will quickly prove fatal to a fireman’s
prospects of advancement. Sobriety is of the first
importance, because a man who is not strictly temperate
should not be tolerated for a moment about a locomotive,
since he is a source of danger to himself and
others; industry is needed to lighten the burden of a
fireman’s duties, for oftentimes they are arduous beyond
the conception of strangers; and wanting in the third
quality, intelligence, a man can never be a good fireman
in the wide sense of the word, since one deficient
in mental tact never rises higher than a human machine.
An intelligent fireman may be ignorant of the scientific
nomenclature relating to combustion, but he will be
perfectly familiar with all the practical phenomena connected
with the economical generation of steam. Such
a man does not imagine that he has reached the limit
of locomotive knowledge when he understands how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>17</span>
to keep an engine hot, and can shine up the jacket.
Every trip reveals something new about his art, every
day opens his vision to strange facts about the wonderful
machine he is learning to manage. And so, week
by week, he goes on his way, attending cheerfully to
his duties, and accumulating the knowledge that will
eventually make him a first-class locomotive engineer.</p>

<h3>MODERN METHODS OF SELECTING FIREMEN.</h3>

<p>On the various roads throughout the North American
continent, there is great diversity of practice in the
selection of men for the position of fireman.</p>

<p>On numerous roads, especially in the Western States,
men are taken from all occupations; no preliminary
training being deemed necessary before putting a man
on an engine as fireman. A list of applicants is kept
by the master mechanic, and likely men recommended
for firemen. When a man is wanted, the first one who
can be found conveniently is sent out; and the engineer
must break him in as best he can. On other roads,
again, the men intended for firemen are taken to work
about the round-house, and are employed in helping
with the cleaning, repairing, and preparing of locomotives
for the road. This plan is greatly in vogue in
Europe, and on certain of the older roads of America;
and it has many features to recommend it over the
practice of placing men entirely devoid of railroad
experience upon engines. It is better for the men
themselves, since working about engines familiarizes
each to some extent with the work he is expected to
do as an engineer’s helper, for that is really a fireman’s
position; it is better for the company, since the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>18</span>
officers get the opportunity of observing a man’s habits
before he receives training that entails some expense;
it is better for the engineer, since his assistant is not
entirely strange to the work he is expected to do.</p>

<h3>FIRST TRIPS.</h3>

<p>A youth entirely unacquainted with all the operations
which a fireman is called upon to perform, finds
the first trip a terribly arduous ordeal, even with some
previous experience of railroad work. When his first
trip introduces him to the locomotive and to railroad
life at the same time, the day is certain to be a record
of personal tribulation. To ride for ten or twelve hours
on an engine for the first time, standing on one’s feet,
and subject to the shaking motion, is intensely tiresome,
even if a man has no work to do. But when he has
to ride during that period, and in addition has to shovel
six or eight tons of coal, most of which has to be
handled twice, the job proves no sinecure. Then, the
posture of his body while doing work is new; he is
expected and required to pitch coal upon certain exact
spots, through a small door, while the engine is swinging
about so that he can scarcely keep his feet; his
hands get blistered with the shovel, and his eyes grow
dazzled from the resplendent light of the fire. Then
come the additional side duties of taking water, shaking
the grates, cleaning the ash-pan, or even the fire,
where bad coal is used, filling oil-cans, and trimming
lamps, to say nothing of polishing and keeping things
clean and tidy. By the time all these duties are
attended to, the young fireman does not find a great
deal of leisure to admire the passing scenery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>19</span></p>

<h3>POPULAR MISCONCEPTION OF A FIREMAN’S DUTIES.</h3>

<p>A great many idle young fellows, ignorant of railroad
affairs, imagine that a fireman’s principal work
consists in ringing the bell, and showing himself off
conspicuously in coming into stations. They look upon
the business as being of the heroic kind, and strive to
get taken on as firemen. If a youth of this kind happens
to succeed, and starts out on a run of one hundred
and fifty miles with every car a heavy engine will
pull stuck on behind, his visions of having reached
something easy are quickly dispelled.</p>

<p>Like nearly every other occupation, that of fireman
has its drawbacks to counterbalance its advantages;
and the drawbacks weigh heaviest during the first ten
days. The man who enters the business under the
delusion that he can lead a life of semi-idleness must
change his views, or he will prove a failure. The man
who becomes a fireman with a spirit ready and willing
to overcome all difficulties, with a cheerful determination
to do his duty with all his might, is certain of success;
and to such a man the work becomes easy after a
few weeks’ practice.</p>

<h3>LEARNING FIREMEN’S DUTIES.</h3>

<p>Practice, combined with intelligent observation, gradually
makes a man familiar with the best styles of
firing, as adapted to all varieties of engines; and he
gets to understand intimately all the qualities of coal
to be met with, good, bad, and indifferent. As his
experience widens, his fire management is regulated to
accord with the kind of coal on hand, the steaming
properties of the engine, the weight of the train, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>20</span>
character of the road and of the weather. Firing, with
all the details connected with it, is the central figure
of his work, the object of pre-eminent concern; but a
good man does not allow this to prevent him from
attending regularly and exactly to his remaining routine
duties.</p>

<h3>A GOOD FIREMAN MAKES A GOOD ENGINEER.</h3>

<p>There is a familiar adage among railroad men, that a
good fireman is certain to make a good engineer; and
it rarely fails to come out true. To hear some firemen
of three months’ standing talk, a stranger might conclude
that they knew more about engine running than
the oldest engineer in the district. These are not the
good firemen. Good firemen learn their own business
with the humility born of earnestness, and they do not
undertake to instruct others in matters beyond their
own knowledge. It is the man who goes into the heart
of a subject, who understands how much there is to
learn, and is therefore modest in parading his own
acquirements, that succeeds.</p>

<h3>LEARNING AN ENGINEER’S DUTIES.</h3>

<p>When a fireman has mastered his duties sufficiently
to keep them going smoothly, he begins to find time
for watching the operations of the engineer. He notes
how the boiler is fed; and, upon his knowledge of the
engineer’s practice in this respect, much of his firing
is regulated. The different methods of using the steam
by engineers, so that trains can be taken over the road
with the least expenditure of coal, are engraven upon
the memory of the observant fireman. Many of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>21</span>
acquirements which commend a good fireman for promotion
are learned by imperceptible degrees,—the
knowledge of speed, for instance, which enables a man
to tell how fast a train is running on all kinds of track,
and under all conditions of weather. There would be
no use in one strange to train service going out for a
few runs to learn speed. He might learn nearly all
other requisites of engine running before he was able
to judge within ten miles of how fast the train was
going under adverse circumstances. The same may be
said of the sound which indicates how an engine is
working. It requires an experienced ear to detect the
false note which indicates that something is wrong.
Amidst the mingled sounds produced by an engine and
train hammering over a steel track, the novice hears
nothing but a medley of confused noises, strange and
meaningless as are the harmonies of an opera to an
untutored savage. But the trained ear of an engineer
can distinguish a strange sound amidst all the tumult
of thundering exhaust, screaming steam, and clashing
steel, as readily as an accomplished musician can detect
a false note in a many-voiced chorus. Upon this ability
to detect growing defects which pave the way to disaster,
depends much of an engineer’s chances of success
in his calling. This kind of skill is not obtained by a
few weeks’ industry: it is the gradual accumulation of
months and years of patient labor.</p>

<h3>CONDITIONS OF ENGINE RUNNING THAT VANQUISH THE INEXPERIENCED
MAN.</h3>

<p>I once knew a machine-shop foreman, a man of extensive
experience in building and repairing engines,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>22</span>
who took a locomotive out on trial trip. A side-rod pin
began to run hot; and, although he was leaning out of
the cab-window, he did not observe any thing wrong
till a drop of babbitt struck him in the eye. An experienced
engineer watching the rods would have detected
the condition of affairs before babbitt was thrown.</p>

<p>A difficult thing for an inexperienced man to control
in running a locomotive at night, when the conditions
of adhesion are bad, is the slipping of the drivers.
Slipping is a simple matter enough to those who feel
it in the vibrations of the engine; but the novice has
not this sensitiveness to slipping vibration developed,
and he must depend upon his eyesight or his hearing
to detect it. On a dark, stormy night, the eye is useless
as a means of judging as to the regularity of the
revolving wheels: the howling wind or rain, rattling
on the cab, drowns the sound of the exhaust. Under
circumstances of this kind, an engine might jerk the
pins out before the empirical engineer discovered the
wheels were slipping.</p>

<h3>LEARNING TO KEEP THE LOCOMOTIVE IN RUNNING-ORDER.</h3>

<p>As his acquaintance with the handling and ordinary
working of the locomotive extends, the aspiring fireman
learns all about the packing of glands, and how
they should be kept so as to run to the best advantage:
he displays an active interest in every thing relating to
lubrication, from the packing of a box-cellar to the
regulating of a rod-cup. When the engineer is round
keying up rods, or doing other necessary work about
his engine, the ambitious fireman should give a helping
hand, and thereby become familiar with the operations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>23</span>
that are likely to be of service when he is required to
draw upon his own resources for doing the same work.</p>

<p>Of late years the art of locomotive construction has
been so highly developed, the amount of strain and
shocks to which each working part is subjected has
been so well calculated and provided against, that
breakages are really very rare on roads where the
motive-power is kept in first-class condition. Consequently,
firemen gain comparatively small insight, on
the road, into the best and quickest methods of disconnecting
engines, or of fixing up mishaps promptly, so
that a train may not be delayed longer than is absolutely
necessary. A fireman must get this information
beyond the daily routine of his experience. He must
search for the knowledge among those competent to
give it. Persistent inquiry among the men posted on
these matters; observation amidst machine-shop and
round-house operations; and careful study of locomotive
construction, so that a clear insight into the physiology
of the machine may be obtained,—will prepare
one to meet accidents, armed with the knowledge which
vanquishes all difficulties. Reflecting on probable or
possible mishaps, and calculating what is best to be done
under all contingencies that can be conceived, prepare
a man to act promptly when a breakdown occurs.</p>

<h3>METHODS OF PROMOTION ON OUR LEADING ROADS.</h3>

<p>In the method of promotion of firemen, considerable
diversity of practice is followed by the different railroads.
On certain roads, with well-established business,
and little fluctuation of traffic, firemen begin work
on switch engines, and are promoted by seniority, or by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>24</span>
selection through the various grades of freight trains,
thence to passenger service, from whence they emerge
as incipient engineers. A more common practice, and
one almost invariably followed in the West, is for firemen
to begin as extra men, in place of firemen who are
sick or lying off. From firing extra, they get advanced,
if found competent and deserving, to regular engines.
Then, step by step, they go ahead to the best paying
runs, till their turn for being “set up” comes round.
Passenger engines are not fired by any but experienced
men, but the oldest firemen do not always claim passenger-runs.
For learning the business of engine-running,
freight service is considered most valuable; and many
ambitious firemen prefer the hard work of a freight
engine on this account.</p>

<h3>NATURE OF EXAMINATION TO BE PASSED.</h3>

<p>When a fireman has obtained the experience that
recommends him for promotion, on nearly all well-regulated
roads he is subjected to some form of examination
before being put in charge of an engine.
In some cases this examination is quite thorough.
The tendency to require firemen to pass such an ordeal
is extending, and its beneficial effect upon the men is
unquestioned. The usual form of examination is, for
officers connected with the locomotive department to
question the candidate for promotion on matters relating
to the management of the locomotive, and how he
would proceed in the event of certain mishaps befalling
the engine. Parties belonging to the traffic department
propound questions relating to road-rules, train-rights,
understanding of time-card, and so on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>25</span></p>

<h3>MASTER MECHANICS ON THE BEST METHOD OF EDUCATING YOUNG
MEN FOR ENGINEERS.</h3>

<p>The Master Mechanics’ Association appointed a committee
to investigate the “best manner of educating
young men for locomotive engineers,” and the following
report was <span class="locked">made:—</span></p>

<p>“Considering this subject to be of vital importance
to the Association, and to the public in general, and that
proper care and attention have not been given to it in
the past, the committee have spared no pains to get all
the information they possibly could on this subject,
knowing and feeling that men selected to fill the responsible
position of locomotive engineers must possess
faculties, that, as a general thing, do not belong to all
the human race; and, as locomotive engineers have to
be selected from the ranks of firemen, they feel that due
care and caution should be exercised in selecting young
men for firemen. Now, to arrive at a proper conclusion,—one
that would be satisfactory to the Association and
to the railways of the country,—your committee sent
circulars to all the master mechanics in the United
States, Canada, and Mexico. We sent out five hundred
and thirty-two circulars, to which we received
seventy-six replies; being an average of one answer to
every seven sent. Many of these replies contain very
valuable information, and were from many of the leading
roads of this country, Canada, and Mexico. Your
committee beg leave to return thanks for the answers
to their circular.</p>

<p>“The opinions given us by the different master
mechanics who replied, were as follows: Five recommended
that none but machinists should be locomotive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>26</span>
engineers; nineteen thought that nothing more
was needed than to have a young man fire from three
to four years with good, competent engineers, to make
him a good runner; fifty-two thought that one year
in the shop and round-house, with two to three years’
firing, was necessary to make a competent engineer;
many recommended that young men, while firing, read
and study books that would give them a general knowledge
of the locomotive, such as <i>Forney’s Catechism of
the Locomotive</i>, and several other works of that kind.
Many of the replies admitted that machinists would
make the best runners if they would consent to fire
one year after having learned their trade, as they would
then have the advantage of knowing all about the construction
of the locomotive. Of course, when speaking
of that class of men, they meant bright, intelligent young
machinists, men with nerve and energy, and quick to act
in cases of emergency. Of course, there are some who
would never make engineers, no matter what opportunities
were given them. If young men of this kind
would consent to run one year or more as firemen, we
could select our locomotive engineers from among that
class; but they will not do it, from the belief that they
are just as competent to run a locomotive as the best
engineer on the road for which they are working: and,
if they are given an opportunity to run an engine, they
are certain to make a failure. This being the fact, we
are compelled to select our engineers from among the
ranks of the firemen, as the best and safest runners.
Now, this being the class of men from which we have
to select our engineers, some uniform mode of instructing
them for the responsible position that many of them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>27</span>
will have to fill in the future, will have to be adopted by
the different railroads in America. Your committee
would therefore recommend the <span class="locked">following:—</span></p>

<p>“All master mechanics should have full control of the
engineers and firemen in the employ of their respective
roads, with full power to hire and discharge the same,—of
course, recognizing the rights that the general
managers or superintendents have to order the discharge
of any engineer or fireman for neglect of duty.</p>

<p>“1st, The qualifications for the position of fireman on
all the railways in America should be as follows: The
applicant should be from eighteen to twenty-four years
old, able-bodied, and in good health, with a good common-school
education, and a fair knowledge of arithmetic,
and of sober and steady habits. All applicants
should be required to make application in their own
handwriting, signing it in the presence of the master
mechanic, or the person he may appoint to hire that
class of men. In selecting men for firemen, great care
should be exercised. The master mechanic should endeavor,
so far as lies in his power, to select energetic,
smart, and active young men,—men of nerve, and presence
of mind, quick to act in cases of emergency which
may occur in the position they may be selected to fill
in the future. If we select men of that kind, there
will be very little difficulty in educating them up to the
proper standard to fill the place of engineers.</p>

<p>“2d, There should be three grades of firemen, classed
as junior, intermediate, and senior firemen,—the young
man just commencing, to be classed as junior fireman,
and so on up to senior fireman; the senior fireman receiving
the highest pay for his services, the others in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>28</span>
proportion. When a fireman has fired four years, and
is worthy of promotion, and fully competent to run a
locomotive, there may be no vacancies in the engineer
force on the road by which he may be employed. In
that case we recommend that he receive a small amount
more per day than the senior fireman (say from fifteen
to twenty cents per day more), and be ranked as veteran
fireman. On the road which one of your committee
represents in this convention, this custom has been in
vogue for a number of years, and has worked exceedingly
well. All the engineers on this road have been
educated under this rule, and to-day no engineers in
the country rank higher than they do.</p>

<p>“Proper care should be taken, in selecting young men
for firemen, as to their ability to distinguish colors in a
practicable, common-sense way. We recommend that
all railroads having a sufficient number of employés
to justify them in so doing, have a reading-room and
library for their firemen and engineers, in which the
other employés could participate. The library, to some
extent, should consist of works on the locomotive engine
that a man with a fair education could understand.
While we do not think it essentially necessary, still we
believe it would be beneficial to some extent to let firemen
work one year out of the four in the shop and
round-house, so that they might obtain a more perfect
knowledge of all the parts of the locomotive.</p>

<p>“Young men consisting of the class we have mentioned,
are certain to make good runners; and there will be no
difficulty, at the proper time, in selecting good junior engineers
from among that class of men. All opportunities
possible should be given firemen to get such knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>29</span>
of the theory and movements of the different parts of the
locomotive as would be beneficial to them when they
enter on their career as engineers. To accomplish
this end, monthly lectures might be given in the reading-room
by men of good practical common sense, who
fully understand what they are talking about. If possible,
these lectures should be given by one of the
engineers. The firemen would learn more from him,
as they would better understand what he was saying;
he having formerly been one of them.</p>

<p>“Your committee is convinced, that, if the mode
recommended by them is adopted generally throughout
the country, a large majority, if not all, of the firemen,
would be educated to a point from which there
would be no difficulty in selecting men who will make
good and reliable engineers.</p>

<p>“3d, The fireman now being competent to run a locomotive,
and being placed in charge of one, has yet some
few things to learn that he did not have the opportunity
of learning, from the fact that he was not running the
engine. While he may run carefully, and avoid accidents,
he has to learn to run his engine with economy
in the consumption of fuel and the cost of repairs. To
learn this, and to give the young engineer an opportunity
to become a first-class man in his occupation, we
recommend there be three grades of engineers,—first,
second, and third grades,—and that the remuneration
they receive be according to grade; the fireman just
promoted ranking in the third grade; after one year’s
service he enters the second grade; when two years
have passed, he enters the first grade, and becomes a
first-class locomotive engineer.”</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>INSPECTION OF THE LOCOMOTIVE.</i></span>
</h2>
</div>

<h3>LOCOMOTIVE INSPECTORS.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">On</span> railroads where the system of “long runs” for
locomotives prevails, there is a locomotive inspector
employed, whose duty it is to thoroughly examine every
available point about every engine that arrives at his
station, and find out what repairs are needed, and to
detect the incipient defects which lead to disaster on
the road. Some roads that do not practice long runs
have an inspector who examines every engine. This
plan is very effectually used on the elevated railroads
of New York, and has much to do with the immunity
from accident of their engines. These inspectors are
not employed to exempt engineers from looking over
their engines, but merely to supplement their care. In
some cases engineers are brought sharply to task if
they overlook any important defect which is discovered
by the inspector.</p>

<h3>GOOD ENGINEERS INSPECT THEIR OWN ENGINES.</h3>

<p>The engineer who has a liking for his work, and
takes pride in making his engine perform its part, so as
to show the highest possible record, does not require
the fear of an inspector behind him as an incentive to
properly examine his engine, and keep it in the best<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>31</span>
running-order. He recognizes the fact, that upon systematic
and regular inspection of the engine while at
rest, depends in a great measure his success as a runner,
and his exemption from trouble.</p>

<h3>WHAT COMES OF NEGLECTING SYSTEMATIC INSPECTION OF LOCOMOTIVES.</h3>

<p>The man who habitually neglects the business of inspecting
his engine, and leaves to luck his chances of
getting over the road safely, soon finds that the worst
kind of luck is always overtaking him on the road. A
careful man may have a run of bad luck occasionally,
but the careless man meets with nothing else. Among
a great many men who have failed as runners, I can
recall numerous cases where carelessness about the
engine was the only and direct cause which led them
to failure. One of the most successful engineers that
ever pulled a throttle on the Erie Railroad was asked
by a young runner to what cause he attributed his
extraordinary good fortune. His reply was, “I never
went out without giving my engine a good inspection.”
This man had been running nearly half a century, and
never needed to have his engine hauled to the round-house.</p>

<h3>CONFIDENCE ON THE ROAD DERIVED FROM INSPECTION.</h3>

<p>When a locomotive is thundering over a road ahead
of a heavy train in which may be hundreds of human
beings, the engineer ought to understand that the
safety of this freight of lives depends to a great extent
upon his care and foresight. As the train rushes
through darkened cuttings, spans giddy bridges, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>32</span>
rounds curves edged by deep chasms, no one can understand
better than the engineer the importance of having
every nut and bolt about the engine in good condition,
and in its proper place. The consciousness that every
thing is right, the knowledge that a thorough inspection
at the beginning of the journey proved the locomotive
to be in perfect condition, give a wonderful
degree of comfort and confidence to the engineer as he
urges his train along at the best speed of the engine.</p>

<h3>INSPECTION ON THE PIT.</h3>

<p>Between the time of an engine’s return from one
trip and its preparation for another, a thorough examination
of all the machinery and running-gear should
be made while the engine is standing over a pit. Monkey-wrench
in one hand, and a torch in the other if
necessary, the engineer ought to enter the pit at the
head of the engine, and make the inspection systematically.
The engine-truck, with all its connections, comes
in for the first scrutiny. Now is the time to guard
against the loss of bolts or screws, which leads to the
loss of oil-box cellars on the road. This is also the
proper time to examine the condition of the oil-box
packing. The engineers of my acquaintance who are
most successful in getting trains over the road on time,
attend to the packing of the truck-boxes themselves.
Nothing is more annoying on the road than hot boxes.
They are a fruitful source of delay and danger, and
nothing is better calculated to prevent such troubles
than good packing and clear oil-holes. The shop-men
who are kept for attending to this work are sometimes
careless. They can hardly be expected to feel so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>33</span>
strongly impressed with the importance of having
boxes well packed as the engineer, who will be blamed
for any delay. He should, therefore, know from personal
inspection that the work is properly done.</p>

<p>When the engineer is satisfied that the truck, pilot-braces,
center-castings, and all their connections, are in
proper condition, he passes on to the motion. His
trained eye scans every bolt, nut, and key in search of
defects. The eccentrics are examined, to see that set
screws and keys are all tight. Men who have wrestled
over the setting of eccentrics on the road are not likely
to forget this part. Eccentric-straps are another point
of solicitude. A broken eccentric-strap is a very common
cause of break-down, and these straps very seldom
break through weakness or defect of the casting. In
nearly all cases the break occurs through loss of bolts,
or on account of oil-passages getting stopped up. The
links are carefully gone over, then the wedges and pedestal
braces come in for an examination which brings
the assurance that no bolts are missing, or wedge-bolts
loose. Passing along, the careful engineer finds many
points that claim his attention; and, when he gets
through, he feels comfortably certain that no trouble
from that part of the engine will be experienced during
the coming trip. The runners who do not follow this
practice are not aware of how much there is to be seen
under a locomotive when the examination is undertaken
in a comprehensive manner.</p>

<h3>OUTSIDE INSPECTION.</h3>

<p>In going round the outside of the engine, the most
important points for examination are the guides and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>34</span>
the rods. Guide-bolts, rod-bolts, and keys, with the set
screws of the latter, are the minutiæ most likely to give
trouble if neglected. In going about the engine oiling,
or for any other purpose, it is a good thing to get in the
habit of searching for defects. When a man trains
himself to do this, it is surprising how natural it comes
to make running inspections. As he oils the eccentric-straps,
he sees every bolt and nut within sight; as he
drops some oil on the rods, he identifies the condition
of the keys, set screws, or bolts; while oiling the
driving-boxes, the springs can be conveniently examined;
and, when he reaches the engine-trucks with the
oil-can, he is sure to be casting his searching eyes over
the portions of the running-gear within sight.</p>

<h3>OIL-CUPS.</h3>

<p>The oil-cups should be carefully examined, to see that
they are in good feeding-order. A great many feeders
have been invented, which guarantee to supply oil automatically;
but I have never yet seen the cup which
could long dispense with personal attention. And this
does not apply to locomotives alone, but to all kinds of
machinery. The worst sort of oil-cup will perform its
functions fairly in the hands of a capable man, and the
most pretentious cup will soon cease to lubricate regularly
if the engineer neglects it. The oil-cups should
be cleaned out at regular intervals: for mud, cinders,
and dust work in; and they sometimes retain glutinous
matter from the oil, which forms a sticky mixture that
prevents the oil from running. The eccentric-strap
cups and the tops of the driving-boxes should receive
similar attention.</p>

<p>In looking round an engine, it is a good plan to watch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>35</span>
the different oil-cups to see that they are not working
loose. Many cups that are strewed over the country
could be saved by a little more attention. A cup flying
off a rod when an engine is running fast becomes
a dangerous projectile. I have known several cases
where cups went back through the cab-window. I
have also seen several cases where cups worked off
the guides or cross-head, and got between the guides,
doing serious damage. One instance was that of an
engine out on the trial-trip. It smashed the cross-head
to pieces, and let the piston through the cylinder-head.</p>

<h3>INSPECTION OF RUNNING-GEAR.</h3>

<p>A sharp tap with a hammer on the tread of the cast-iron
wheel will produce a clear, ringing sound if the
wheel is in good order. The drivers can generally be
effectively inspected by the eye. If oil be observed
working out between the wheel and axle, attention is
demanded; for the wheel may be getting loose. Moisture
and dirt issuing from between the tire and wheel
indicate that the former is becoming loose, and this is
a common occurrence when the tires are worn thin.
When a wheel is running so that the flange is cutting
itself on the rail, something is wrong, which also demands
immediate attention. Oblique travel of wheels
may be produced by various causes. If the axles of
the driving-wheels are not secured at right angles to
the frames, and parallel with each other, the wheels will
run tangentially to the track, according to the inclination
of the axles. Violent strains or concussions, such as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>36</span>
result from engines jumping the track about switches,
sometimes spring the frames, and twist the axle-box
jaws away from their true position enough to cause
cutting of flanges without disabling the engine. Tires
wearing unevenly in consequence of one being harder
than the other, produce a similar effect. Where there
are movable wedges forward and aft of the boxes, the
wheels are often thrown out of square by unskillful
manipulation of these wedges. Engineers running engines
of this kind should leave the forward wedges
alone. Sometimes the center-pin of the engine-truck
gets moved from the true central position, leading the
drivers towards the ditch. Diagnosing the cause of
wheel-cutting is no simple matter, and it is a wise plan
for engineers to allow the shop-men to devise a remedy.</p>

<h3>ATTENTIONS TO THE BOILER.</h3>

<p>On our well-regulated roads, engineers are not required
to inspect their boilers; as expert boiler-makers,
who can readily detect a broken stay-bolt, or broken
brace, have to make periodical examinations. But a
prudent engineer will keep a sharp lookout for indications
that show weak points about any part of the
boiler or fire-box. This department can not receive too
much vigilance. A seam or stay-bolt leaking is a sign
of distress, and should receive immediate attention.
Leaks under the jacket should never be neglected,
although they are hard to reach; for they may proceed
from the beginning of a dangerous rupture. A leak
starting in the boiler-head should make the engineer
ascertain that none of the longitudinal braces have
broken. I once had some rivet-heads on my boiler-head<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>37</span>
start leaking, and presently the water-glass broke.
After shutting off the cocks, I found that the boiler-head
was bulged out. I reduced the pressure on the
boiler as quickly as possible. When the boiler was
inspected, it was found that two of the longitudinal
braces were broken, and the head-sheet was bent out
two inches.</p>

<h3>MISCELLANEOUS ATTENTIONS.</h3>

<p>If an engineer is going to take out an engine the
first time after it has been in the shop for repairs, it
is a good plan to examine the tank to see if the workmen
have left it free from bagging, greasy waste, and
other impediments, which are not conducive to the free
action of pumps or injectors. Keeping the tank clean
at all times saves no end of trouble through derangement
to feeding-apparatus. The smoke-box door should
be opened regularly, and the petticoat-pipe and cone
examined. These things wear out by use, and it is
better to have them renewed or repaired before they
break down on the road. A cone dropping down
through failure of the braces makes a troublesome
accident on the road. I have known of several cabs
being badly damaged by fire through the cone dropping
down, and closing up the stack. Where engines have
extended smoke-boxes, the nettings and deflectors must
be inspected at frequent intervals.</p>

<h3>REWARD OF THOROUGH INSPECTION.</h3>

<p>To go over an engine in the manner indicated, requires
perseverance and industry. The work will, however,
bring its full reward to every man who practices<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>38</span>
the care and watchfulness entailed by regular and systematic
inspection. It is the sure road to success. He
who regards his work from a higher plane than that of
mere labor well done, will experience satisfaction from
the knowledge, that, understanding the nobility of his
duties, he performed them with the vigor and intelligence
worthy of his responsible calling.</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>GETTING READY FOR THE ROAD.</i></span>
</h2>
</div>

<h3>RAISING STEAM.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">It</span> used to be the universal custom, that, when an
engine arrived from a trip, the fire was drawn, and
the engine put into the round-house for ten or twelve
hours before another run was undertaken. During
this period of inaction, the boiler partly cooled down.
When the engine was wanted again, a new fire was
started in time to raise steam. The system of long
runs, introduced on many roads, has changed this; and
engines are now generally kept hot, unless they have to
be cooled down for washing out, or repairs. When an
engine comes in off a trip, the fire is cleaned from
clinker and dead cinders, and the clean fire banked.
It is found that this plan keeps the temperature of
the boiler more uniform than is possible with the cooling-down
practice, and that the fire-box sheets are not
so liable to crack, or the tubes to become leaky.</p>

<p>Where it is still the habit to draw the fire at the end
of each trip, a supply of good wood is kept on hand for
raising steam. To raise steam from a cold boiler, some
theorists recommend the starting of a fire mild enough
to raise the temperature about twenty degrees an hour.
The exigencies of railroad service prevent this slow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>40</span>
method from being practicable, and the ordinary practice
is to raise steam as promptly as possible when it
is wanted.</p>

<h3>PRECAUTIONS AGAINST SCORCHING BOILERS.</h3>

<p>The first consideration before starting a fire in a
locomotive, is to ascertain that the boiler contains the
proper quantity of water. The men who attend to the
starting of fires should be instructed not to depend
upon the water-glass for the level of the water, but to
see that it runs out of the gauge-cocks. I have known
several cases where boilers were burned through those
firing up being deceived by a false show of water in the
glass, and starting the fire when the boiler was empty.
If the boiler has been filled with water through the
feed-pipes by the round-house hose, care should be
taken to see that the check-valves are not stuck up.
Where there is sand in the water, it frequently happens,
that, in filling up with a hose, all the valves get sanded,
and do not close properly. When there is steam on the
boiler, this source of danger will generally be indicated
at once by the steam and water blowing back into the
tank; but, where the boiler is cold, the water flows back
so silently and slowly, that the crown-sheet may be dry
before the peril is discovered.</p>

<h3>STARTING THE FIRE.</h3>

<p>The water being found or made right, the next consideration
is the grates. Before throwing in the wood,
all loose clinkers left upon the grates should be cleaned
off: care should be taken, to see that the grates are in
good condition, and connected with the shaker levers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>41</span>
This is also the time to see that no accumulation of
cinders is left on the brick arch, the water-table, or in
the combustion chamber, should the engine be provided
with either of these appliances. In starting the fire, it
is considered the best plan to put enough wood in the
fire-box to raise sufficient steam to operate the blower
before the fire needs replenishing. To do the job in a
clean, workman-like manner, the fire should be started
from below: otherwise every part of the cab will be
veneered with soot and dust, and the bright work tarnished.</p>

<h3>FIREMAN’S FIRST DUTIES.</h3>

<p>On most roads, the engineer and fireman are required
to be at their engine from fifteen minutes to
half an hour before train-time. A good fireman will
reach the engine in time to perform his preliminary
duties deliberately and well. He will have the dust
brushed off from the cab-furnishing, and from the conspicuous
parts of the engine, the deck swept clean, the
coal watered, and the oil-cans ready for the engineer.
His fire is attended to, and its make-up regulated,—the
kind of coal used, the train to be pulled, and the character
of the road on the start. With an easy or down
grade, for a mile or two on the start, the fire does not
need to be so well made up as when the start is made
on a heavy pull. But every intelligent fireman gets to
understand in a few weeks just what kind of a fire is
needed. It is the capability of perceiving this and
other matters promptly, that distinguishes a good from
an indifferent fireman. When a young fireman possesses
these “true workman” perceptions, and is of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>42</span>
an industrious, aspiring disposition, anxious to become
master of his calling, he will prove a reliable help to
the engineer; and his careful attention to the work will
insure comfort and success on every trip. There must
be a certain amount of work done on the engine, to get
a train along; and, if the fireman can not do his part
efficiently, it will fall upon the engineer, who must get
it done somehow.</p>

<h3>SAVING THE GRATES.</h3>

<p>An important duty, which is never neglected by first-class
firemen, before taking the engine away from the
round-house, is that of looking to the grates, and seeing
that the ash-pan is clean. When grates get burned,
in nine cases out of ten it happens through neglecting
the ash-pan. Some varieties of bituminous coal have
an inveterate tendency to burn the grates. Such coal
usually contains an excess of sulphur, which has a
strong affinity for iron, and at certain temperatures
unites with the surface of the grates, forming a sulphuret
of iron. Neglecting the ash-pan, and letting
hot ashes accumulate, prepares the way for bad coal to
act on the grates. Keeping the ash-pan clear of hot
ashes is the best thing that can be done to save grates,
since that prevents the iron from becoming hot enough
to combine with sulphur.</p>

<h3>SUPPLIES.</h3>

<p>Before starting out, the fireman ought to ascertain
that all the supplies necessary for the trip are in the
boxes; that the requisite flags, lanterns, and other signals
are on hand, and that all the lamps are trimmed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>43</span>
He should also know to a certainty that all his fire-irons
are on the tender, that the latter is full of water, and
that the sand-box is full of sand.</p>

<p>These look like numerous duties as preliminary to
starting, but they are all necessary; and the fireman
who attends to them all with the greatest regularity,
will be valued accordingly. Nearly all firemen are ambitious
to become engineers. The best method they
can pursue, to show that they are deserving of promotion,
is to perform their own duties regularly and well.
A first-class fireman will save his wages each trip over
the expenditure made by the mediocre fireman: a persistently
bad fireman should be sent to another calling
without delay. Few railroad companies can afford the
extravagance of a set of bad firemen.</p>

<h3>ENGINEER’S FIRST DUTIES.</h3>

<p>Try the water. That is the most important call upon
the engineer when he first enters the cab. If the engine
has a glass water-gauge, he should ascertain by
the gauge-cocks if the water-level shown in the glass
be correct. A water-glass is a great convenience on
the road, but it should only be relied on as an auxiliary
to the gauge-cocks. Many engineers have come to
grief through reposing too implicit confidence in the
water-glass. Engineer Williams was considered one of
the most reliable men on the A. &amp; B. road. With an
express train he started out on time one morning; and
he had run only two miles when the boiler went up in
the air, with fatal results to both occupants of the cab.
An examination of the wreck showed unmistakable evidence
of overheated sheets. Circumstantial evidence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>44</span>
indicated that the glass had deceived the engineer by
a false water-level. When he pulled out, the fire-box
sheets, which were of copper, became weakened by the
heat, so that the crown-sheet gave way; the re-action
of the released steam tearing the boiler to pieces.
Numerous less serious accidents originating from the
same cause might be cited.</p>

<h3>REACHING HIS ENGINE IN GOOD SEASON.</h3>

<p>An engineer who has a proper interest in his work,
and thoroughly appreciates the importance of it, will
reach his engine in time to perform the duties of
getting her ready for the road leisurely, without rush
or hurry. Although a good fireman may relieve the
engineer of many preliminary duties, the engineer himself
should be certain that the necessary supplies and
tools are on the engine, and that water is in the tank,
and the sand-box filled.</p>

<h3>OILING THE MACHINERY.</h3>

<p>Oiling the machinery is such an important part of an
engineer’s work, and the success of a fast run is so dependent
upon this being properly done, that it should
never be performed hurriedly. Although practice with
short stoppages at stations may have got an engineer
into the way of rushing round an engine, and oiling at
express-speed, it is no reason why the first oiling of the
trip should not be carefully and deliberately attended to
when there is an opportunity. In addition to filling oil-cups,
lubricators, and oil-boxes, this is a good time to
complete the inspection, which assures the engineer
that every thing about the engine is in proper running-order.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>45</span>
When any thing in the way of repairs has
been done to the engine since she came off the last
trip, special attention has generally to be given to the
parts worked at. New wheels require close care with
the packing of the boxes; rod-brasses reduced entail
an additional supply of oil to the pins for the first
few miles; guides closed should insure a free supply
of oil till it is found that the cross-heads run cool.</p>

<h3>QUANTITY OF OIL THAT DIFFERENT BEARINGS NEED.</h3>

<p>While oiling, the engineer should bear in mind that
it is of paramount importance that the rubbing-surfaces
receive lubrication sufficient to keep them from
heating; but, while making sure that no bearings shall
run dry, lavish pouring of oil should be avoided. There
are still too many cases to be noticed, of men pouring
oil on the machinery without seeming to comprehend
the exact wants. We are constantly seeing cases where
oil-cups waste their measure of oil through neglect in
adjusting the feeders. A steady supply, equal to the
requirements, is what a well-regulated cup provides.
With the ordinary quality of mineral oil, six drops will
lubricate the back end of a main rod for one mile when
the engine is pulling a load. This applies to eight-wheel
engines on passenger service. Heavier small-wheeled
engines will require a quarter more oil. Guides can
be kept moist with five drops of oil to the mile. A
dry, sandy road will require a more liberal supply.
With good feeders, properly attended to, the supply
can equal the demand with close accuracy. An oil-cup
which runs out the oil faster than it is needed,
wastes stores, besmears every thing with a coating of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>46</span>
grease, and is likely to leave the rubbing-surfaces to
suffer by running dry before it can be replenished. A
cup in that condition also advertises the engineer to be
incompetent.</p>

<h3>LEAVING THE ENGINE-HOUSE.</h3>

<p>Before moving the engine out of the house, the cylinder-cocks
should be opened so that water, or the steam
condensed in warming the pipes and steam-chest, may
escape. After ringing the bell, and giving workmen
employed about the engine time to get out of the way,
the throttle should be opened a little, and the engine
moved out slowly and carefully. If there is a sufficient
pressure of steam in the boiler, and the engine refuses
to move, something is wrong. Never force an engine.
Any work which may have been performed upon it
while in the house will probably indicate the nature
of the defect. The most common cause of stalling
engines in the house is a miscalculation of the piston-travel,
permitting it to push against the cylinder-head.
Sometimes, however, the setting of the valves is at
fault. I knew a case where the machinist connected
the backing-up eccentric-strap with the top of the link,
and the mistake was not discovered till they attempted
to move the engine out of the house. Another blunder,
the result of gross carelessness, was where a
cold chisel was left in the steam-chest. But a more
representative case was that which happened to Engineer
Amos, on the B. &amp; C. road. His engine had the
piston-packing set up; and the following morning, when
he tried to take it out of the house, it would not pass
a certain point. Thinking that the packing was set up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>47</span>
rather tight, he backed for a start, determined to make
it go over on the run. He succeeded, too, but a hammer
which had been left in the cylinder went out through the
cover.</p>

<p>While running from the round-house to the train, is a
good time to carefully watch the working of the various
parts of the engine. Should any defects exist, they are
better to be detected now than after the engine is out
with a train. The brakes can be tested conveniently
at this time, and the working of the water-pumps tried.
All these matters are regularly attended to by the successful
engineer: they are habitually neglected by the
unlucky man, and misfortune never loses sight of him.</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>RUNNING A FAST FREIGHT TRAIN.</i></span>
</h2>
</div>

<h3>RUNNING FREIGHT TRAINS.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">By</span> far the greater proportion of American locomotive
engineers are employed on freight service. On most
roads, the freight engines constitute from seventy-five
to ninety per cent of the whole locomotive equipment.
On this kind of service, locomotive engineers learn
their business by years of hard practice in getting
trains over the road as nearly as possible on time.
On the best of roads, there is much hardship to be
undergone, working ahead through every discouragement
of bad weather or hard-steaming engines. The
man who brings the most energy, good sense, and perseverance
to his aid, will come out most successfully
above these difficulties.</p>

<p>Every department of locomotive engine running has
difficulties peculiar to itself. Every kind of train needs
to be handled understandingly, to show the best results;
but, I think, getting a heavy fast freight train on time,
over a hilly road, having a single track, requires the
highest degree of locomotive engineering skill. Therefore,
I have selected that form of train as the first
subject of description.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>49</span></p>

<h3>THE ENGINE.</h3>

<p>The engine that takes the train over the road weighs
35 tons, and has 1,100 square feet of heating-surface for
generating steam for cylinders 17 by 24 inches, which,
through the pistons, transmit power to wheels 60 inches
diameter. The engine is an ordinary eight-wheeled
bituminous coal-burning American type of locomotive,
built by one of our best makers, and well adapted for
pulling any kind of train over a Western railroad.</p>

<h3>THE TRAIN.</h3>

<p>This consists of 20 loaded cars, making an aggregate
weight of 450 tons.</p>

<h3>THE DIVISION.</h3>

<p>The physical character of the country, which is rolling
prairie, makes the road undulatory,—up hill, then down
grade, with occasional stretches of level track. Some
of the gradients rise to sixty feet to the mile, extending
over two miles without sagging a foot. Sound steel
rails, well tied, are supported by a graveled road-bed,
making an excellent track, and presenting a good opportunity
for fast running where high speed is needed.
The train is run on card-time, stopping about every
twelve miles. Like all other Western roads, the stations
are unprotected by signals; and the safety of
trains is secured mostly by vigilance on the part of the
engineer and other train-men.</p>

<h3>PULLING OUT.</h3>

<p>When the engineer gets the signal to go, he drops
the reverse lever into the full forward notch, gives the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>50</span>
engine steam gently, with due care to avoid breaking
couplings, and pulls the sand-lever. A slight sprinkling
of sand only is dropped on the rails, which keeps the
engine from slipping while getting the train under way.
A clear, level fire is burning over the grates before the
start is made, and this suffices till the most crowded
switches are passed: so, when the signal to start is
given, the fireman closes the fire-door, and opens the
damper; these duties not preventing him from keeping
a lookout for signals.</p>

<h3>HOOKING BACK THE LINKS.</h3>

<p>As the engine gets the train into motion, the engineer
gradually hooks up the links. This is not done by
a sudden jerk as soon as the engine will move, with the
steam cutting off short. He waits for that till the train
is well under the control of the engine, hooking up
gradually. Some men think that it is best to get the
valves up to short travel as soon as possible, without
reflecting that it is better for the motion to let the
engine be going freely before hooking up short. I have
often seen men coming into terminal stations with a
heavy fire and the safety-valves blowing, and the engine
toiling slowly along with the links hooked up to eight
inches cut. In cases of this kind, a runner may better
work the engine well down, so that the valve will travel
freely over the seat. By doing so when the engine is
working slow and heavy, there will be less wear to the
valves, and less danger of breaking a valve yoke. It is
only in cases where there is an advantage in saving
steam, that benefit is derived from working the engine
close hooked back. There is a right time for all things,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>51</span>
and working steam expansively is no exception to the
rule.</p>

<h3>WORKING THE STEAM EXPANSIVELY.</h3>

<p>At the right time, our engineer gets the reverse lever
notched up; for he knows, that to obtain the greatest
amount of work out of the engine, with the least possible
expenditure of fuel, the links must be hooked back
as far as can be done consistently with making the
required speed. Some engines will not steam freely
when run close back if they are burning coal that needs
a strong draught. This is the exception, however, and
most engines will steam best in this position; and many
of those that fail to steam well cutting off short are not
properly fired, or the draught appliances need adjusting.
Most firemen who run with a heavy fire fail worst
with engines that steam indifferently when hooked up.
Engineers should give this their attention, and do
every thing possible to make the engine steam while
working with the lever as near the center notch as can
be done while handling the train.</p>

<h3>ADVANTAGE OF CUTTING OFF SHORT.</h3>

<p>When the links are notched close towards the center,
the travel of the valves is so short that they close the
steam-ports shortly after the beginning of the stroke, at
six, nine, or twelve inches of the piston’s travel, as the
case may be, permitting the steam to push the piston
along the remainder of the stroke by its expansive
power. Steam at a high pressure is as full of potential
energy as a compressed spiral spring, and is equally
ready to stretch itself out when the closing of the port
imprisons it inside the cylinder; and, by this act of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>52</span>
expanding, it exerts immense useful energy, which
would escape into the smoke-stack unutilized if the
cylinders were left in communication with the boiler
till the release took place. Suppose, for instance, that
a boiler pressure of ten tons is exerted upon the piston
from the beginning to the middle of the stroke, and is
then cut off. During the remainder of the stroke, the
steam will continue to press upon the piston with a
regularly diminishing force, till, at the end of the stroke,
if release does not take place earlier, it will still have a
pressure of five tons. The work performed by the
steam during the latter part of the stroke is pure gain,
due to its expansive principle. If the steam is cut off
earlier, at a third or fourth of the piston travel, the gain
will be correspondingly great. With the slide-valve
link-motion used on locomotives, the steam can not be
held to the end of the stroke; but the principle of expansion
holds good during the period the steam is held
in the cylinders after the cut-off.</p>

<p>The observing engineer of any experience does not
require to have the advantages of working his engine
expansively impressed upon his attention. His fuel-record
has done that more eloquently than pen can
write.</p>

<h3>BOILER PRESSURE BEST FOR ECONOMICAL WORKING.</h3>

<p>There is a close and constant relation between the
boiler pressure carried, and the useful work obtained
from expansion of steam. The higher the pressure, the
greater elasticity the steam possesses. The tendency
of modern steam engineering is, to employ intensely
high boiler pressure, expanding the steam by means of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>53</span>
excellent valve-gear in steam-jacketed cylinders, so that
it is reduced to low tension before escaping into the
atmosphere, or into the condenser, as the case may be.
Wonderfully economical results have been obtained in
this manner,—results which can never be approached
in locomotive practice while the ordinary slide-valve is
used. But, while we can not hope to rival the record of
high-class automatic cut-off engines, their methods can
teach us useful lessons.</p>

<p>It is advisable to keep the steam constantly close to
the blowing-off point. During a day’s trip, considerably
less water will be evaporated when a tension of 140
pounds is carried, than will be required with a pressure
of 100 pounds or under. And, where less water is evaporated,
a smaller quantity of fuel will be consumed in
doing the work. Running with a low head of steam is
a wasteful practice, for several good reasons. The
comparatively light pressure upon the surface of the
water allows the steam to pass over damp, or mixed
with a light watery spray, which diminishes its energy;
since the wet steam contains less expansive medium
than dry steam. It requires nearly the same expenditure
of fuel to evaporate water at the pressure of the atmosphere
alone, that it does to make steam at the higher
working tensions: consequently, the work obtained by
the expansion of the high-pressed steam is clear gain
over the results to be obtained by working at a low
pressure. This is a very important principle in economical
steam engineering. Engineers who are accustomed
to making long runs between water-tanks, when
every gallon is needed to carry them through, know
that their sure method of getting over the dry division<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>54</span>
successfully, is to carry steam close to the popping-point,
pull the throttle wide open, hug the links close
to the center, and see that no loss occurs through the
safety-valves.</p>

<h3>RUNNING WITH LOW STEAM.</h3>

<p>There are engineers who habitually carry merely
sufficient steam to get them along on time, under the
mistaken belief that they are working economically.
John Brown runs steadily, and takes as good care of his
engine as any man on the A. &amp; B. road; but he dislikes
to hear the steam escaping from the safety-valves, and
prevents it from doing so by habitually using steam
thirty pounds below the blowing-pressure. The consequence
is, that he always makes a bad record on the
coal-list, compared with the other passenger men.</p>

<h3>THE THROTTLE-LEVER.</h3>

<p>In the interest of economy, the throttle-lever should
be kept wide open when practicable, and the speed
regulated by the reverse-lever. Experiments with the
indicator have demonstrated beyond a doubt, that running
with the throttle-valve partly closed, wire-draws
the steam before it reaches the cylinders, whereby the
initial pressure is materially reduced, and its power for
expansive work seriously diminished.</p>

<h3>MANAGEMENT OF THE FIRE.</h3>

<p>The engine has moved only a few rods from the
depot when the steam shows indications of blowing off;
and then the fireman sets to work,—not to pile a heap
of coal indiscriminately into the fire-box. That is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>55</span>
style of the dunce whose natural avocation is grubbing
stumps. Ours is a model train, and a model fireman
furnishes the power to keep it going. He throws in
four or five shovelfuls at each firing, scattering the coal
along the sides of the fire-box, shooting a shower close
to the flue-sheet, and dropping the required quantity
under the door. With the quick intuition of a man
thoroughly master of his business, our model fireman
perceives at a glance, on opening the door, where the
thinnest spots are; and they are promptly bedded over.
The glowing, incandescent mass of fire, which shines
with a blinding light that rivals the sun’s rays, dazzles
the eyes of the novice, who sees in the fire-box only a
chaotic gleam; but the experienced fireman looks into
the resplendent glare, and reads its needs or its perfections.
The fire is maintained nearly level; but the coal
is supplied so that the sides and corners are well filled,
for there the liability to drawing air is most imminent.
With this system closely followed, there is no difficulty
experienced in keeping up a steady head of steam. But
constant attention must be bestowed upon his work by
the fireman. From the time he reaches the engine,
until the hostler takes charge at the end of the journey,
he attends to his work, and to that alone; and by this
means he has earned the reputation of being one of the
best firemen on the road. His rule is, to keep the fire
up equal to the work the engine has to do, never letting
it run low before being replenished, never throwing in
more coal than the keeping up of steam calls for. The
coal is broken up moderately fine, a full supply being
prepared before the fire-door is opened; and every shovelful
is scattered in a thin shower over the fire,—never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>56</span>
pitched down on one spot. Some men never acquire
the art of scattering the coal as it leaves the shovel;
and, as a result, they never succeed in making an engine
steam regularly. Their fire consists of a series of coal-heaps.
Under these heaps, clinkers are prematurely
formed; and between them spaces are created, through
which cold air comes, and rushes straight for the flues,
without assimilating with the gases of combustion, as
every breath of air which enters the fire-box ought
to do.</p>

<h3>CONDITIONS THAT DEMAND GOOD FIRING.</h3>

<p>Roads that are hilly require far more skillful management
to get a train along than is called for on level
roads, and the greater part of the extra dexterity is
needed from the fireman. To get a heavy train up a
steep hill, it is generally run at a high speed before
reaching the grade, so that the momentum of the
train can be utilized in climbing the ascent. Running
for a hill is a particularly trying time on the fireman;
for the engine is rushing at a high speed, and often
working heavily. This ordeal must be prepared for
in advance, by having the fire well made up, and kept
at its heaviest by frequent firing. When the engine
gets right on to the grade, toiling up with decreasing
speed, every pound of steam is needed to save doubling,
and steady watchfulness is required to prevent a relapse
of steam; but the danger of the engine “turning” the
fire is not nearly so great as it was when running fast
for the hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>57</span></p>

<h3>HIGHEST TYPE OF FIREMAN.</h3>

<p>The highest type of fireman is one, who, with the
smallest quantity of fuel, can keep up a good head of
steam without wasting any by the safety-valves. He
endeavors to strike this mean of success by keeping an
even fire; but it sometimes happens, that the closest
care will not prevent the steam from showing indications
of blowing off. When this is the case, he keeps
it back by closing the dampers, or, if that is not sufficient,
opens the door a few inches. Immense harm is
done to flues and fire-boxes by injudicious firing.</p>

<h3>SCIENTIFIC METHODS OF GOOD FIREMEN.</h3>

<p>It is not necessary that a man should be deeply read
in natural philosophy, to understand intimately what are
actually the scientific laws of the business of firing.
Mr. Lothian Bell, the eminent metallurgist, somewhere
expresses high admiration for the exact scientific methods
attained in their work by illiterate puddlers. Although
they knew nothing about chemical combinations
or processes, they manipulated the molten mass so that,
with the least possible labor, the iron was separated
from its impurities. In a similar way, firemen skillful
in their calling have, by a process of induction, learned
the fundamental principles of heat-development. By
experiments, carefully made, they perceive how the
greatest head of steam can be kept up with the smallest
cargo of coal; and they push their perceptions into
daily practice.</p>

<p>If an accomplished scientist were to ride on the
engine, observing the operations of a first-class fireman,
he would find that nearly all the carbon of the coal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>58</span>
combined with its natural quantity of oxygen to produce
carbon dioxide, thereby giving forth its greatest heat-power;
and that the hydro-carbons, the volatile gases of
the coal, performed their share of calorific duty by
burning with an intensely hot flame. He would find
that these hydro-carbon gases, although productive of
high-power duty when properly consumed, were ticklish
to manage just right, for they would pass through the
flues without producing flame if they were not fully
supplied with air; and, if the supply of air were too
liberal, it would reduce the temperature of the fire-box
below the igniting-point for these gases, which is higher
than red-hot iron, and they would then escape in the
form of worthless smoke. Our model fireman manages
to consume these gases as thoroughly as they can be
consumed in a locomotive fire-box.</p>

<h3>THE MEDIUM FIREMAN.</h3>

<p>John Barton is considered a first-class fireman by
some men. He works hard to keep up steam, and is
never satisfied unless the safety valves are screaming.
He carries a heavy fire all the time; and, when the pop-valves
rise, he pulls the door open till they subside,
gets in a few shovelfuls more coal, closes the door till
the steam blows off again, and repeats the operation of
throwing open the door. This man has learned only
the half of his business. He has got through his head
how to keep up steam, but he has not acquired the
more delicate operation of keeping it down wisely and
well. Training with an intelligent engineer anxious to
make a good fuel-record, will, in a few months, improve
Barton wonderfully. Barton is the medium fireman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>59</span></p>

<h3>THE HOPELESSLY BAD FIREMAN.</h3>

<p>Behind him comes Tom Jackson, the man of indiscriminately
heavy firing. Tom’s sole aim is to get over
the road with the least possible expenditure of personal
exertion. He tumbles in a fire as if he were loading a
wagon, the size of the door being his sole gauge for the
lumps. When the fire-box is filled to the neighborhood
of the door, he climbs up on the seat, and reclines there
till the steam begins to go back through drawing air:
then he gets down again, and repeats the filling-up process,
intent only on getting upon the seat-box with as
little delay as possible. His firing is regulated by the
appearance of the smoke issuing from the stack. So
long as it continues of murky blackness, he reclines in
happiness: when the first streaks of transparency appear
in the smoke, he becomes unhappy, but gets up,
and suppresses smoke-consumption by smothering the
flames with green coal. If by any chance the engine
steams so freely that the safety-valves blow, the door is
jerked wide open, and kept there till she cools down.
So the round goes. A hot, scorching fire, which heats
the sheets and flues to their highest temperature, is
continually being interrupted by the sudden cooling
from a heavy load of damp coal, or a chilling current
of cold air. No wonder, that, with such treatment, leaky
flues, weeping stay-bolts, and pouring mud-rings, make
their own protests, often reiterated on the pages of
round-house work-books.</p>

<h3>WHO IS TO BLAME FOR BAD FIRING?</h3>

<p>The destruction inflicted upon the heating-surface of
locomotives by the changes of temperature due to bad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>60</span>
firing, should be charged to the engineer. The fireman
commits the havoc, but the engineer is more to blame
for allowing it to be done. Engineers often permit firemen
to do their work badly rather than have words
about it. But this is mistaken policy. A little firmness
in the start will convince the worst of firemen that
they must strive to fire properly, or quit; and a man
who is indisposed to do his work well, deserves his walking-papers
without delay. There is no kindness in
retaining a hopelessly bad fireman on an engine. As a
fireman, he is a continual loss to his employers; he is
no credit to his fellow-workmen; and if, by the mistaken
forbearance of engineers, he ever reaches the right-hand
side, he will be a reproach to the engineering
fraternity.</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>GETTING UP THE HILL.</i></span>
</h2>
</div>

<h3>SPECIAL SKILL AND ATTENTION REQUIRED TO GET A TRAIN UP
A STEEP GRADE.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">In</span> the last chapter, some details were given of the
methods pursued in starting out with a heavy fast
freight train. Where a train of that kind has to climb
heavy grades, special skill and attention are needed in
making the ascent successfully.</p>

<h3>GETTING READY FOR THE GRADE.</h3>

<p>The track for the first two miles from the starting-point
is nearly level, permitting the engineer and fireman
to get ready for a long pull not far distant. At
the second mile-post a light descending grade is reached,
which lasts one mile, and is succeeded by an ascending
grade two and a half miles long, rising fifty-five feet to
the mile.</p>

<h3>WORKING UP THE HILL.</h3>

<p>At the top of the descending grade, the engineer
shuts off the steam while the fireman oils the valves:
then he puts on a little steam, using a light throttle
while the train is increasing in speed, until the base of
the ascent is nearly reached, when he gets the throttle
full open, letting the engine do its best work in the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>62</span>
notch off the center. By this time the train is swinging
along thirty miles an hour, and is well on to the
hill before the engine begins to feel its load. Decrease
of speed is just becoming perceptible when the valve-travel
gets the benefit of another notch, and the engine
pulls at its load with renewed vigor. But soon
the steepness of the ascent asserts itself in the laboring
exhausts; and the reverse-lever is advanced another
notch, to prevent the speed from getting below the
velocity at which the engine is capable of holding the
train on this grade. While the engineer is careful to
maintain the speed within the power of his locomotive,
he is also watchful not to increase the valve-travel faster
than his fire can stand it; for, were he to jerk the lever
two or three notches ahead at the beginning of the pull,
the chances would be that he would “turn” its fire, or
tear it up so badly that the steam would go back on him
before he got half a mile farther on. Before the train
is safe over the summit, it will probably be necessary to
have the engine working down to 18 inches: but the
advance to this long valve-travel is made by degrees;
each increase being dependent upon, and regulated by,
the speed. The quadrant is notched to give the cut-off
at 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 inches. Repeated experiments,
carefully watched, have convinced the engineer
of this locomotive, that its maximum power is exerted
in the 18-inch notch; so he never puts the lever down
in the “corner” on a hill. A great many engines act
differently, however, showing increased power for every
notch advanced. If the cars in the train should prove
easy running,—and there are great differences in cars
in this respect,—it may not be necessary to hook the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>63</span>
engine below 15 inches, or even 12 will suffice for some
trains; but this can only be determined by seeing how
it holds the speed in the various notches.</p>

<h3>WHEEL-SLIPPING.</h3>

<p>As the engine gets well on to the grade, and is exerting
heavy tractive power, the wheels are liable to
commence slipping; and it is very important that they
should be prevented from doing so. An ounce of prevention
is known to be worth a pound of cure; and it
pays an engineer to assure himself that no drips from
pump-glands, or feed-pipes, or cylinder-cocks, or from
any other fountain, are dropping upon the rails ahead
of the driving-wheels. There is no use telling an engineer
of the decreased adhesion which the drivers exert
on half-wet rails, from what they do on those that are
clean and dry. Knowing the difference in this respect,
every engineer should endeavor to prevent the wetting
of the rails by leaks from his engine; for hundreds of
engines get “laid down” on hills from slipping induced
by this very cause.</p>

<h3>HOW TO USE SAND.</h3>

<p>The first consideration in this regard is to have clean,
dry sand, and easy-working box-valves. Then the engineer
should know how far the valves open by the distance
he draws the lever. In starting from a station, or working
at a point where slipping is likely to commence, the
valves should be opened a little, and a slight sprinkling
of sand dropped on the rails. This often serves the
purpose of preventing slipping just as well as a heavy
coating of sand. And it has none of the objectionable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>64</span>
features of thick sanding. Trains often get stalled on
grades by the sand-valves being allowed to run too
freely. It is not an uncommon occurrence for engineers
to open the valves wide, and let all the sand run
upon the rails that the pipe will carry, so that a solid
crust covers each rail, and every wheel on the train
gets clogged with the powdered silica; and, after the
train has passed over, a coating is left for the next one
that comes along.</p>

<p>The wheels scatter their burden of powdered sand
into the axle-boxes, and it grinds its way inside the
rod-brasses, and part of it gets wafted upon the guides;
and in all these positions it is matter decidedly in the
wrong place. And this body of sand under the wheels
increases the resistance in the same way, as a wagon is
harder to pull among gravel than it is on a clean, hard
road: the indiscreet engineer complains about the train
being stiff to haul; and the chances are, that he goes
twice up the hill before the whole train is got over.
Uncle Toby’s plan is, when pulling on a heavy grade,
to open the valve enough to let the drivers leave a
slight white impression on the rails. If they slip, he
gives a few particles more sand, but decreases the
supply again so soon as the drivers will hold with the
diminished quantity. Uncle Toby seldom needs to
double a hill.</p>

<h3>SLIPPERY ENGINES.</h3>

<p>These remarks apply to ordinary engines with ordinary
rail-conditions. Occasionally we find an engine
inveterately given to slipping, and no conditions seem
able to keep it down. Such an engine is as ready to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>65</span>
whirl its wheels as an ugly mule is to kick up its heels,
and upon as little provocation. With a dirty, half-wet
rail, an engine of this kind loses half its power. The
causes that make an engine bad for slipping are various.
Very hard steel tires, or excess of cylinder power,
are the most frequent causes of slipping; but badly worn
tires sometimes produce a similar effect; or the blame
may rest in a short-wheel base, deficient in weight, or
in too flexible driving-springs. To get a slippery engine
over the road when the rails are moist and dirty, requires
the exercise of unmeasured patience by the engineer.
Job was a cantankerous old Arab beside the engineer
who passes cheerfully through this ordeal. The tendency
of an engine to slip may be checked to some
extent by working with the lever well ahead towards
full stroke, and throttling the steam. This gives a more
uniform piston-pressure than is possible while working
expansively. Of two evils, it is best to choose the least.
The smallest in this case is losing the benefits of expansion,
and getting over the road.</p>

<h3>FEEDING THE BOILER.</h3>

<p>Some engineers claim that the most economical results
can be obtained from an engine by running with
the water as low as possible, consistent with safety.
They hold, that, so long as the water is sufficiently
high to cover the heating-surfaces, there is enough to
make steam from; and the ample steam-room remaining
above the water, assures a more perfect supply of
dry steam for the cylinders than can be had from the
more contracted space left above a high-water line.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>66</span>
Old engineers, running locomotives furnished with entirely
reliable feeding-apparatus, may be able to carry
a low-water level advantageously, especially with light
trains and level roads; but with ordinary men, average
pumps or injectors, and the common run of roads, a
high-water level is safest. With a high-water level the
temperature of the boiler can be kept nearly uniform;
for the increased volume of water holds an accumulated
store of heat, which is not readily affected by the feed.
And the surplus store is convenient to draw upon in
making the best of a time-order, or in getting over a
heavy grade. Then, if the pumps or injectors fail, a full
boiler of water often enables a man to examine the
delinquent feeding-apparatus, and set it going; whereas,
with low water, the only resource would be to dump the
fire.</p>

<h3>CHOICE OF PUMP AND INJECTOR.</h3>

<p>The engine on this train has one pump and one injector.
The pump is preferred for ordinary feeding-purposes,
and is kept graduated to supply the needs
of the boiler while the engine is working, without the
foot-cock being moved. On a heavy pull, the pump
in this condition would not keep up the water-level; so
the injector is called upon to make up the deficiency.
When the engine gets upon the heavy part of the grade,
it makes steam very freely; and, when the indications of
getting hot appear, the injector is started. During the
remainder of the ascent, the water is supplied as liberally
as it can be carried; and the top of the grade finds the
engine with a full boiler. This enables the engineer
to preserve a tolerably even boiler temperature; for in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>67</span>
running down the long descent which follows, where
the engine runs two miles without working steam, the
pump can be shut off, and sudden cooling of the boiler
avoided. The preservation of flues and fire-box sheets
depends very much upon the manner of feeding the
water. Some men are intensely careless in this matter.
In climbing a grade, they let the water run down
till there is scarcely enough left to cover the crown-sheet
when they reach the summit. Then they dash
on the feed, and plunge cold water into the hot boiler,
which is then peculiarly liable to be easily cooled down,
owing to the limited quantity of hot water it contains.
The fact of having the steam shut off, greatly aggravates
the evil; for there is then no intensity of heat
passing through the flues to counteract the chilling
effect of the feed-water. If it is necessary to pump
while running with the steam shut off, the blower should
be kept going; which will, in some measure, prevent the
change of temperature from being dangerously sudden.
There will probably be some loss from steam blowing
off, but that is the smaller of two evils.</p>

<p>Engineers are not likely to feed the boiler too lavishly
when working hard, for the injection of cold water instantly
shows its effect by reducing the steam-pressure.
But this is not the case when running with the throttle
closed. The circulation in the boiler is then so sluggish,
that the temperature of the water may be reduced
many degrees, while the steam continues to show its
highest pressure.</p>

<p>Writers on physical science tell us that the temperature
of water and steam in a boiler is always the same,
and varies according to pressure; that, at the atmosphere’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>68</span>
pressure, water boils at 212 degrees, and produces
steam of the same temperature. At 10 pounds
above the atmospheric pressure, the water will not evaporate
into steam until it has reached a temperature of
240 degrees, and so on: as the pressure increases, the
temperature of water and steam rises. But under all
circumstances, while the water and steam remain in
the same vessel, their temperature is the same. This
is an acknowledged law of physical science; yet every
locomotive engineer of reflection, who has run on a hilly
road, knows that circumstances daily happen where the
law does not hold good.</p>

<h3>FALL OF BOILER-TEMPERATURE NOT INDICATED BY THE STEAM-GAUGE.</h3>

<p>If an engine, of the class represented as pulling our
train, passes over the top of the grade with half an inch
of water in the glass, there will be about 700 gallons in
the boiler. Now, suppose it runs down the hill without
using steam, and keeps pumping till the water rises six
inches in the glass, there will be about 200 gallons more
water in the boiler. It is no unusual thing to do this
with a mild fire, and yet have no diminished tension
of steam shown by the gauge, although 200 gallons of
water of about 60 degrees have been injected amongst
700 gallons at 361 degrees, the temperature due to a
steam-pressure of 140 pounds. This ought to reduce
the mean temperature below 300 degrees, yet the
pointer of the steam-gauge keeps indicating 140. That
the pressure of steam and the temperature of the water
do not accord, is shown directly the throttle is opened
to perform work. The brisk circulation due to the rush<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>69</span>
of steam through the dry pipe now brings the temperature
of water and steam to equilibrium, and backward
the index of the steam-gauge travels. The steam-pressure
goes back faster than is due to the supply drawn
for the cylinders; because the latent heat of the steam
passes into the water, helping to bring the whole contents
of the boiler to an even temperature.</p>

<h3>SOME EFFECTS OF INJUDICIOUS BOILER-FEEDING.</h3>

<p>Meanwhile, with an engine operated in this fashion,
the train will probably stand for fifteen minutes, till
sufficient steam is raised to proceed with.</p>

<p>The fact that newly injected water does not immediately
rise in temperature to the heat indicated by the
pressure-gauge, can also be tested by filling up a boiler
with an injector while the engine is at rest on a side-track.
Working an injector causes greater circulation
than feeding with a pump, and the water goes into the
boiler at a higher temperature. For this reason the
injector is superior to the pump as a feeding-medium.
But, if the engineer pulls out directly after filling up
the boiler with an injector, the steam will go down a
few pounds, no matter how good a fire may be on the
grates.</p>

<p>On level roads, the pump or injector should be set to
supply the needs of the boiler; and a skillful engineer
can regulate this so well, that the foot-cock has seldom
to be moved. The best results in getting trains over
the road, and in preserving boilers, are obtained in this
way. The runner who adopts the intermittent system
of feeding is always in trouble, or, as the boys say, “he
is always nowhere.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>70</span></p>

<h3>CAREFUL FEEDING AND FIRING PRESERVE BOILERS.</h3>

<p>A case where the conservative effect of careful firing
and feeding was strikingly illustrated, came under the
author’s notice a year or two ago. During the busiest
part of the season, the fire-box of a freight engine belonging
to a Western road became so leaky that the
engine was really unfit for service. Engines, like individuals,
soon lose their reputation if they fail to perform
their required duties for any length of time. This engine,
“29,” soon became the aversion of train-men.
The loquacious brakeman, who can instruct every railroad-man
how to conduct his business, but is lame
respecting his own work, got presently to making big
stories out of the amazing quantity of water and coal
that “29” could get away with, and how many trains
she would hold in the course of a trip. The road was
suffering from a plethora of freight, and extreme scarcity
of engines; and on this account the management
was reluctant to take this weakling into the shop. So
the master mechanic turned “29” over to Engineer
Macleay, who was running on a branch where delays
were not likely to hold many trains. Mac deliberated
about taking his “time” in preference to the engine,
which others had rejected, but finally concluded to give
the bad one a fair trial. The first trip convinced the
somewhat observant engineer that the tender fire-box
was peculiarly susceptible to the free use of the pump,
and to sudden changes of the fire’s intensity of heat.
So he directed the fireman to fire as evenly as possible,
never to let the grates get bare enough to let cold air
pass through, to keep the door closed except when
firing, to avoid violent shaking of the grates, and never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>71</span>
to throw more than three or four shovelfuls of coal into
the fire-box at one time. His own method was, to feed
with persistent regularity, to go twice over heavy parts
of the division in preference to distressing the engine
by letting the water get low, and then filling up rapidly.
This system soon began to tell on the improved condition
of the fire-box. The result was, that, within a
month after taking the engine, Mac was pulling full
trains on time; and this he continued to do for five
months, till it was found convenient to take the engine
in for rebuilding.</p>

<h3>OPERATING THE DAMPERS.</h3>

<p>According to the mechanical dictionary, a damper
is a device for regulating the admission of air to a
furnace, with which the fire can be stimulated, or the
draught cut off, when necessary. Some runners regard
locomotive dampers in a very different light. They
seem to think the openings to the ash-pan are merely
holes made to let air in, and ashes out; that doors are
placed upon them, which troublesome rules require to
be closed at certain points of the road to prevent
causing fires. Those who have made their business a
study, however, understand that locomotive dampers
are as useful, when properly managed, as are the
dampers of the base-burner which cheers their homes
in winter weather. To effect perfect combustion in
the fire-box, a certain quantity of oxygen, one of the
constituents of common air, is required to mix with
the carbon and carbureted hydrogen of the coal. The
combination takes place in certain fixed quantities. If
the quantity of air admitted be deficient, a gas of inferior<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>72</span>
calorific power will be generated. On the other
hand, when the air-supply is in excess of that needed
for combustion, the surplus affects the steam-producing
capabilities of the fire injuriously; since it increases
the speed of the gases, lessening the time they are in
contact with the water-surface, and a violent rush of
air reduces the temperature of portions of the fire-box
below the heat at which carbureted hydrogen burns.</p>

<h3>LOSS OF HEAT THROUGH EXCESS OF AIR.</h3>

<p>In the fire-boxes of American engines, where double
dampers are the rule, far more loss of heat is occasioned
by excess of air than there is waste of fuel
through the gases not receiving their natural supply
of oxygen. The blast from the nozzles creates an impetuous
draught through the grates; and when to this is
added the rapid currents of air impelled into the open
ash-pan by the violent motion of the train, the fire-box
is found to be the center of a furious wind-storm. The
excess of this storm can be regulated by keeping the
front damper closed, and letting the engine draw its
supply of air through the back damper. When the
fire begins to get dirty, and the air-passages between
the grates become partly choked, the forward damper
can be opened with advantage. So long as an engine
steams freely with the front damper closed, it is an indication
that there is no necessity for keeping it open.
With vicious, heavy firing, all the air that can be
injected into the fire-box is needed to effect indifferently
complete combustion; and the man who follows
this wasteful practice can not get too much air through
the fire. Consequently, it is only with moderately light<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>73</span>
firing that regulation of draught can be practiced. Running
with the front damper open all the time is hard on
the bottom part of the fire-box, and the ever-varying
attrition of cold wind is responsible for many a leaky
mud-ring.</p>

<h3>LOSS OF HEAT FROM BAD DAMPERS.</h3>

<p>In Britain, where far more attention has been devoted
to economy of fuel than has been bestowed upon the
matter this side of the Atlantic, locomotives are provided
with ash-pans that are practically air-tight, and
the damper-doors are made to close the openings. In
many instances, the levers that operate the dampers
have notched sectors, so that the quantity of air admitted
may equal the necessities of the fire. British
locomotives, as a rule, show a better record in the use
of their fuel than is found in American practice; and
a high percentage of the saving is due to the superior
damper arrangements.</p>

<p>Imagine the trouble and expense there would be with
a kitchen-stove that had no appliance for closing the
draught! Yet some of our locomotive builders turn out
their engines with practically no means of regulating
the flow of air beneath the fire.</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>FINISHING THE TRIP.</i></span>
</h2>
</div>

<h3>RUNNING OVER ORDINARY TRACK.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> hill which our train encounters nearly at the
beginning of the journey is the <i>Pons Asinorum</i> of the
division. The style in which it is ascended shows what
kind of an engine pulls the train, and it tests in a
searching manner the ability of the engineer. Our
engine has got over the summit successfully; and the
succeeding descent is accomplished with comfort to the
engine, and security to the train. And so the rest of
the trip goes on. The train speeds merrily along
through green, rolling prairies, away past leafy woodlands
and flowery meadows: it cuts a wide swath
through long cornfields, startles into wakefulness the
denizens of sleek farmhouses, and raises a rill of excitement
as it bounds through quiet villages. But
every change of scene, every varied state of road-bed,—level
track, ascending or descending grade,—is prepared
for in advance by our engine-men. Their engine
is found in proper time for each occasion, as it requires
the exertion of great power, or permits the conservation
of the machine’s energy. Over long stretches of undulatory
track the train speeds; each man attending to his
work so closely that the index of the steam-gauge is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>75</span>
almost stationary, and the water does not vary an inch
in the glass. This is accomplished by regular firing
and uniform boiler-feeding, two operations which must
go together to produce creditable results.</p>

<h3>STOPPING-PLACES.</h3>

<p>There are few stops to be made, and these are mostly
at water-stations. Here the fireman is ready to take
in water with the least possible delay; and, while he is
doing so, the engineer hurries around the engine, feeling
every box and bearing, and dropping a fresh supply
of oil where necessary. And, while going thus around,
he glances searchingly over the engine, his eye seeking
to detect absent nuts, or missing bolts or pins: any
thing wrong may now be observed and remedied.</p>

<p>At the coaling-stations the fireman finds time to
rake out the ash-pan, and the engineer bestows upon
the engine and tender a leisurely inspection besides
oiling around.</p>

<h3>KNOWLEDGE OF TRAIN-RIGHTS.</h3>

<p>Next to studying the idiosyncrasies of his engine,
our model engineer prides himself on his intimate
acquaintance with the details of the time-table. The
practice becoming so common on our best-regulated
railroads, of examining candidates for promotion to the
position of engineer on their knowledge of the time-table,
has a very salutary effect upon aspiring firemen,
and induces them to acquire familiarity with the rules
governing train-service, which they never forget.</p>

<p>Our engineer is well posted on all the rules relating
to the movement of trains; his mind’s eye can glance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>76</span>
over the division, and note meeting or passing points;
and the relative rights of each train stand blazoned
forth in bold relief before his mental vision. This
knowledge regulates his conduct while nearing stations;
for, although every stopping-point is approached
cautiously, those places where trains may be expected
to be found, are run into with vigilant carefulness, the
train being under perfect control. Depending blindly
upon conductors and brakemen to keep safe control
of the train at dangerous points is opening the gate of
trouble. An engineer is jointly responsible with the
conductor for the safety of his train, and he should
make certain that every precaution is taken to get
over the road without accident.</p>

<h3>PRECAUTIONS TO BE OBSERVED IN APPROACHING AND PASSING
STATIONS.</h3>

<p>Running past stations where trains are standing side-tracked,
requires to be done with special care, particularly
in the case of passenger trains; for, at such points,
there is danger of persons getting injured by stepping
inadvertently past a car or a building, in front of a
moving train. This peril is guarded against by reducing
the speed as far as practicable, after whistling to
warn all concerned, by ringing the engine-bell, and
keeping a sharp lookout from the cab.</p>

<h3>THE BEST RULES MUST BE SUPPLEMENTED BY GOOD JUDGMENT.</h3>

<p>Rules framed by the officers of our railways for the
guidance of employes are always safe to follow as far
as they go, and neglect of their behests will soon entail
disaster. But circumstances sometimes arise in train-service<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>77</span>
to which no rule applies, and the men in charge
must follow the dictates of their judgment. This happens
often, especially on new roads; and the men who
prove themselves capable of wrestling successfully with
unusual occurrences, of overcoming difficulties suddenly
encountered, are nature’s own railroaders. It is this
practice of acting judiciously and promptly, without the
aid of codified directions, which gives to American railroad
men their striking individuality, known to the
men of no other nation following the same calling.
European railway servants carry ponderous books of
“rules and regulations” in their pockets, and these
rules are expected to furnish guidance for every contingency;
so, when an engine-driver or guard gets into
an unusual dilemma, he turns over the pages of his
rule-book for counsel and direction. The American
engineer or conductor under similar circumstances
takes the safe side, and goes ahead.</p>

<h3>OPERATING SINGLE TRACKS SAFELY.</h3>

<p>For many years to come, the great majority of our
railroads will be single tracks, as they now are. The
operating of single-track roads is only done safely by
the exercise of unsleeping vigilance on the part of all
concerned in the movement of trains. Delays sometimes
occur through mistaken excess of caution, as in
the case of an engineer in Iowa, who mistook the lantern
of a benighted farmer for the headlight of an
approaching train, and backed to the nearest telegraph
station; or that of a conductor in Michigan, who side-tracked
his train to let the evening star pass. Such
mistakes make pleasantry among train-men, but all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>78</span>
acknowledge that it is better to err on the safe side
than to run recklessly into danger.</p>

<p>On this subject the remarks of Kirkman are strongly
applicable. Writing on the “intelligent discrimination
exercised by train men,” he says, “It is observable in
the practical application of the system under which
trains are operated, that the employes connected with
the train service do not always attach the significance
to specific signals or rules that would naturally be supposed.
Especially is this so in reference to use of signals.
Their acquaintance with the every-day working
of trains teaches them that allowance must always be
made for the ignorance, stupidity, or thoughtlessness
of employes; and they strive constantly to protect
themselves, and the passengers and property intrusted
to their care, from the fatal effects that would oftentimes
follow a blind obedience to the orders given
them.... The engineer of an irregular train that is
running under special telegraphic instructions at the
rate of sixty miles an hour, can not depend implicitly
upon the accuracy of the reports he receives in reference
to the location and intention of other trains....
His orders are to proceed. He has been trained to
obey. Outwardly he is unconcerned, but inwardly he
is filled with apprehension; and, as he proceeds on his
course, he scrutinizes the track with an intensity and
a sagacity that never wearies.”</p>

<h3>CAUSES OF ANXIETY TO ENGINEERS.</h3>

<p>“The anxiety upon the part of the engineer is not
occasioned by fear for his personal safety, though that
doubtless has its influence; but it is the knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>79</span>
born of observation and experience, that blind adherence
to orders, no matter what the circumstances, or
from whom emanating, may not only cost him his life,
but may involve the lives of many others,—the lives of
people believing in him, and trusting in him, and as
unconscious of danger as they are helpless to avoid it.”</p>

<h3>ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE ROAD.</h3>

<p>Next in importance to knowing well how to manage
the engine, and intimate familiarity with the time-table
and its rules, comes acquaintance with the road. In
the light of noonday, when all nature seems at peace,
when every object can be seen distinctly, the work of
running over a division is as easy as child’s play. But
when thick darkness covers the earth, when the fitful
gleam of the headlight shines on a mass of rain so
dense that it seems like a water-wall rising from the
pilot, or when blinding clouds of snow obliterate every
bush and bank, it is important that the engineer should
know every object of the wayside. A person unaccustomed
to the business, who rides on a locomotive
tearing through the darkness on a stormy night, sees
nothing around but a black chaos made fitfully awful
by the glare from the fire-box door. But even in the
wildest tempest, when elemental strife drowns the
noise of the engine, the experienced engineer attends
to his duties calmly and collectedly. A cutting or
embankment, a culvert or crossing, a tree or bush, is
sufficient to mark the location; and every mile gives
landmarks trifling to the uninitiated, but to the trained
eye significant as a lighted signal. One indicates the
place to shut off steam for a station, another tells that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>80</span>
the train is approaching a stiff-pull grade; and the
engine-men act on the knowledge imparted. And so
the round of the work goes. Working and watching
keep the train speeding on its journey. Nothing is
left to chance or luck: every movement, every variation
of speed, is the effect of an unseen control. As
a stately ship glides on its voyage obedient as a thing
of life to the turn of the steersman’s wheel; so the
king of inland transportation, the locomotive engine,
the monarch of speed, the ideal of power in motion,
pursues its way, annihilating space, binding nations into
a harmonious unit, and all the time submissive to the
lightest touch of the engineer’s hand.</p>

<p>To get a freight train promptly over the road day
after day, or night after night, an engineer must know
the road intimately, not only marking the places where
steam must be shut off for stations or grades, but every
sag and rise must be engraved on his memory. Then
he will be prepared to take advantage of slight descents
to assist in getting him over short pulls, where, otherwise,
he would lose speed; and the same knowledge
will avail him to avoid breaking the train in two while
passing over the short depressions in the track’s alignment,
called sags in the West.</p>

<h3>FINAL DUTIES OF THE TRIP.</h3>

<p>With an engine properly fired, there is but little
special preparation needed for closing up the trip without
waste of fuel. The fire is regulated so that a head
of steam will be retained sufficient to take the engine
into the round-house after the fire-box is cleaned out.
In drawing the fire, the blower should be used as sparingly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>81</span>
as possible; for its blast rushes a volume of cold
air through the flues, which is apt to start leaks. Many
engineers find flues, or stay-bolts, which were dry at
the end of one trip, leaking when the engine is taken
out for the next run. In nine cases out of ten, the
cause has been too much blower. So soon as the ash-pan
is cleaned out, the dampers should be closed so
that the fire-box and flues may cool down gradually.</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>RUNNING A FAST PASSENGER TRAIN.</i></span>
</h2>
</div>

<p>Materials for the following notes were taken during
a trip on the Pennsylvania <span class="locked">Railroad:—</span></p>

<h3>AVERAGE SPEED.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> New York and Chicago limited express train,
run on the Pennsylvania system of railroads, passes
over the distance of 912 miles between the two cities
in twenty-five hours and twenty-nine minutes, making
an average speed of 35.29 miles an hour. All the
known resources of mechanical science have been ransacked
to produce appliances for reducing delays, so
that the highest possible percentage of the time provided
for the journey should be devoted to running.
Water for steam-making is collected, as the train runs
along, from troughs placed in the middle of the track; a
system of absolute block signals, controlled by vigilant
train-dispatchers, provides a clear line; and stops are
made only for the purpose of changing the locomotives
at the end of divisions. The lines over which the train
runs traverse a multitude of cities and towns, most of
them having the streets crossing the track on the level;
and a great many other railroads are crossed at grade.
Therefore, although the actual stops between Jersey
City and Chicago are only seven, a run exceeding ten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>83</span>
miles without meeting with the necessity of checking
the speed is rare.</p>

<h3>SPEED BETWEEN JERSEY CITY AND PHILADELPHIA.</h3>

<p>The run of ninety miles from Jersey City to Philadelphia
is made at an average speed of 45 miles an hour,
leaving an average of 34 miles an hour for the remainder
of the journey. To keep on time, some parts of
the first division must be traversed at a speed over 60
miles an hour, while 50 miles an hour must be maintained
over a considerable portion of the other divisions.</p>

<h3>REQUISITES OF A HIGH-SPEED LOCOMOTIVE.</h3>

<p>The first essential for a high-speed locomotive is the
means of generating steam freely as fast as it is used
up by the cylinders. The next consideration is properly
designed steam-distribution gear, and well-proportioned
machinery, so that the heat energy produced by
the boiler may be converted into useful work in propelling
the engine with the least possible loss of power.
To handle the fast trains between New York and Philadelphia,
the mechanical talent of the Pennsylvania Railroad,
aided by fifty years’ inherited experience, has
produced the form of engine known as Class K. This
is an anthracite-coal-burning locomotive, with 1,205
square feet of heating-surface to supply steam to cylinders
18 inches by 24 inches, which turn two pairs of
coupled drivers 78 inches in diameter. The traction
force of the engine is thus (18<sup>2</sup> × 24)/78 = 99.69 pounds
for each pound of effective pressure per square inch of
the pistons. The valves are the plain slide, with 1<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>84</span>¼
inch outside lap, no inside lap, 1/16 inch lead in full gear,
and a full travel of 5½ inches. The steam-ports are
16¾ inches long and 1½ inches wide; while the exhaust
port is 3¼ inches wide, securing free emission of steam.</p>

<h3>MAKING UP THE FIRE.</h3>

<p>Locomotives belonging to this company are not permitted
to cool down, unless the fire has to be drawn
that work may be done. At the end of a trip, the fire
is cleaned and banked to wait for the next run. By
getting to the round-house two hours before train-time,
we find our engine receiving the first work of preparation
for the trip. The fire is spread over the grates,
and a fresh supply of coal laid over the whole fire. To
make an engine steam freely with anthracite coal, it is
very important that the fire should be properly burned
through before starting out. About two hours’ time is
needed for this, so that the mass of coal will get properly
ignited without the aid of the blower. A fire that
has to be forced along with the blower never proves
satisfactory.</p>

<h3>GETTING READY FOR THE TRIP.</h3>

<p>The engineer and fireman reach the round-house
about half an hour before train-time, and each proceeds
to do his own line of work preparing the engine for the
run. The engineer attends to oiling round,—an important
matter where ninety miles have to be passed
without stopping. Each bearing and rubbing surface
is provided with an oil-cup, with feed carefully regulated
to supply the required lubrication. Mechanical ingenuity
has arranged excellent methods for securing regular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>85</span>
lubrication, but the care and skill of the engineer are
needed to keep them working properly. As he moves
round the engine, his trained eye detects the smallest
defect; and, as he examines every cup and reservoir,
the touch in time that prevents delay is given wherever
needed. At the same time the machinery gets a final
inspection, and the air-pump is started going. Meanwhile,
the fireman has been attending to his duties,—giving
the fire its finishing touches, filling oil-cans, and
brushing the dust off the cab-fittings.</p>

<p>Now we back up to the train. The air-hose is
coupled, two minutes’ fast pumping of the air-pump
charges the car reservoirs with their full pressure of
air, and we are ready for the start. While waiting for
the signal, I look into the fire-box, and see a furnace
10 feet long and 42 inches wide filled up with coal to a
depth of 10 inches. It takes about a ton and a half of
coal to make this fire ready for the road. The fire was
level on the surface; but the greatest depth was in the
front, where the grates slope downward. The fire-box
alone gives a heating-surface of 120 square feet.</p>

<h3>THE TRAIN TO BE PULLED.</h3>

<p>The train consists of five Pullman sleeping-cars and
one dining-car, the six cars weighing 200 tons. The
engine and tender, in working order, weigh 74 tons,
which gives a total weight of 274 tons to be moved by
the force exerted by the pistons.</p>

<h3>THE START.</h3>

<p>As the signal is given to start, the engineer drops
the links full forward by means of the steam reverse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>86</span>
gear, pulls the throttle lever open, and the engine responds
by moving forward. A sprinkling of sand is
dropped upon the rails, the throttle-valve is opened a
little wider, and with resounding exhausts the engine is
working into speed. From the start, the necessity of
pushing forward, and utilizing every second of time, is
recognized. The train has not moved more than its
own length when a speed of ten miles an hour is
reached. The engineer now hooks back the links to
cut off at ten inches, pulls the throttle wide open, and
“lets her go.” While waiting at the station, steam was
kept down to 130 pounds by the injector and heater.
The injector was shut off just before starting. When
we got out about half a mile, the steam-gauge began to
point towards 140, the popping pressure; and the engineer
started the injector, and it was kept going continually
during the remainder of the trip. It is a No. 9
Sellers, and can supply the boiler during the heaviest
work without reaching the limit of its capacity. There
is a No. 8 injector on the fireman’s side, but it is never
used to run by. The injector and air-pump are two
things about these engines that seldom need to be
touched on the road after they are set to work.</p>

<h3>GETTING THE TRAIN OVER THE ROAD.</h3>

<p>The first two miles out of Jersey City a grade of
about 40 feet is ascended, but the summit is reached in
four minutes; then the links are hooked up to the 8-inch
cut-off, which is the ordinary running-point with this
train. Next mile is passed in 85 seconds, but is finished
by shutting off steam to let the engine roll over
a bridge. Here the valves are oiled, a duty which is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>87</span>
repeated three times during the trip. Although steam
was shut off for only about 300 yards, the speed was
perceptibly reduced; and it took a minute and a half to
make the next mile. Three miles succeeding that were
traversed in 3½ minutes, one of them being run in 59
seconds; but again a demand for reduced speed intervened
in the shape of the street-crossings of Newark,—the
city being approached by a sharp curve. Here the
speed was reduced to 12 miles an hour, and two miles
were run at a rate under 30 miles an hour. A spurt is
again made; and the second mile, after getting clear of
the street-crossings, is passed in 63 seconds, the next
mile in 61 seconds, when another reduction of speed
for Elizabeth streets and a railroad crossing takes place.
After passing this town, a speed of one mile in 57 seconds
was attained, several miles having been traversed
in a minute each: then came the watering-point, where
the speed was reduced under 20 miles an hour. Thus
it was through the whole trip,—a struggle to get up
speed: then comes the necessity for dissipating part of
the power gained in raising the load to the required
velocity. The engine maintained a speed of sixty miles
an hour easily enough; but it was a laborious proceeding,
increasing the speed in a couple of miles from a
mile in two minutes to a mile in one minute. Several
heavy grades were ascended, one of them three miles
long, which reduced the speed in the second two miles
to 30 miles an hour, although the links were dropped to
ten inches cut-off. The highest speed attained during
the run was a mile in 55 seconds. The greatest speed
was reached with the links hooked back to cut-off at 7
inches. It is well understood by engineers running<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>88</span>
these trains, that high velocity can only be attained
with the lever well notched back. Sixty miles an hour
is nearly the maximum speed these engines will make
cutting off at 8 inches, and the train is so heavy that
the amount of steam represented by that cut-off is
needed to maintain the speed on curves or slightly
ascending grades. The fastest running is done under
the favorable conditions of a straight, level track, or
descending grade, where the engine can handle the
train at 6 or 7 inches cut-off. When running over 60
miles an hour, if the lever be advanced a notch the
speed will decrease; for more steam gets into the cylinders
than can be exhausted at the high piston velocity,
and back pressure ensues, which acts as a brake upon
the engine. Even with the big driving-wheels of this
locomotive, the piston-speed at 60 miles an hour is very
high. In traversing a mile in one minute, the wheels
make 258½ revolutions, giving a piston-speed of 1,034
feet.</p>

<h3>HOW THE ENGINEER DID HIS WORK.</h3>

<p>The engineer exhibited remarkable skill and intelligence
in handling the engine. The water was carried
steady without any fluctuation, which enabled the fireman
to maintain the steam at an even pressure. Where
the speed had to be reduced, no more braking was done
than was absolutely necessary; and the brake was applied
so gradually, that it was hard to distinguish that
the speed was not being reduced merely through natural
loss of inertia. Every time the steam was shut off,
the links were dropped, giving the valves full travel.
Many engineers do not recognize the urgent necessity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>89</span>
for doing this. They will shut off steam, and leave the
engine running hooked up, a practice which proves
destructive to valves, their seats, pistons, and cylinders.
Take the case of this engine cutting off at six inches
of the stroke. As the piston moves from the point of
cut-off to the point of release, a partial vacuum is
formed in the cylinder; and, as soon as the valve opens
the exhaust, the hot, cinder-laden gases from the smoke-box
rush in through the nozzles to fill the void in the
cylinder. During the return stroke, compression begins
about eight inches before the completion of the
stroke; and, as the compression is too great for the valve
to hold down, it is jerked violently away from its seat,
causing the clattering so well known where engines are
running hooked up after the steam is shut off. I have
known several cases of valves getting “cocked” from
this cause alone.</p>

<h3>QUALIFICATIONS THAT MAKE A SUCCESSFUL ENGINEER.</h3>

<p>The ability to manage his engine skillfully, so that
its best powers may be economically developed, is the
first requisite of a good engineer; but that qualification
must be supplemented by others scarcely less essential.
Sagacity, sound judgment, judicious self-reliance, are
attributes which advance men in all callings; and they
are peculiarly valuable possessions for the man who
presides over the safety of a railway train. It would be
hard to find a business where capacity for suddenly
adapting circumstances to ends is likely to prove so
useful as it is to an engineer. Some men get along
smoothly with engine and train so long as every thing
goes on regularly,—trains on time, and engines in perfect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>90</span>
order. But let the least difficulty arise, and they
succumb like a house of cards. Imbecile, helpless
creatures, they are vanquished by the first cloud of
trouble. Their true vocation is away from railways.
Self-confidence is not always popular; but the engineer
who is perfectly satisfied with his own ability to grapple
successfully with every emergency, to overcome
every difficulty, and avoid every danger, is the individual
who gets trains promptly over the road. He who
possesses adaptability for railroading acquires a mastery
of the work quickly, but mere affinity for the calling
will not invest a man with the aggregation of facts
respecting the business which are requisite for meeting
the emergencies of train service. This must be acquired
by industry and observation.</p>

<h3>HOW THE FIRING WAS DONE.</h3>

<p>The fireman’s part of the work of getting the train
over the road was no less skillfully done than that of
the engineer. During the first seven miles of the trip,
he did nothing for the fire other than crack up some
coal-lumps. All the coal burned was broken down to
pieces about the size of two bricks. When he seemed
to think the proper time had come, he glanced at the
fire, then threw in one shovelful of coal. To pitch coal
upon the right spot in a fire-box ten feet long, requires
considerable skill when the engine is swinging at a
mile-a-minute speed; but this youth seemed equal to
the task. He did not pile in a load of coal, and then
climb up into the cab, to wait for it to burn, as is the
practice of the poor fireman. After he began to fire, he
kept at it. About every two minutes he got in a shovelful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>91</span>
of coal. When the engine was working hard getting
into speed, he varied his intervals of firing; but he
worked on a system, which was to keep up the body of
fire, and maintain the temperature as nearly even as
possible. He followed scientific methods, whether he
understood any thing about science or not. He never
hesitated about the spot where the coal was going, but
pitched it in, and closed the door quickly, waiting till
the turn for the next installment came round. By this
means the steam never felt the chilling effect that results
from heavy-charge firing. The steam-gauge index
kept pointing at 135 as steadily as if it had been fastened
there. About eight miles from Philadelphia the fireman
stopped putting in coal, and in the remainder of the run
he several times used the hoe to level the fire.</p>

<p>When we stopped at the station, about four inches of
glowing cinders covered the grates.</p>

</div>

<h3>IMPORTANCE OF LOCOMOTIVES STEAMING FREELY.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">As</span> the purpose of a locomotive engine attached to a
train is to take that train along on time, and as engines
are generally rated to pull cars according to their size,
it is of the utmost importance that they should make
steam freely enough to keep up an even pressure on the
boiler while the cylinders are drawing the supply necessary
to maintain speed. A locomotive that does not
generate steam as fast as the cylinders use it, is like a
lame horse on the road, a torture to itself, and to every
one connected with it.</p>

<h3>ESSENTIALS FOR GOOD-STEAMING ENGINES.</h3>

<p>To steam freely, an engine must be built according
to sound mechanical principles. The locomotives constructed
by our best manufacturers, the engines which
keep the trains on our first-class roads moving like
clock-work, are designed according to proportions which
experience has demonstrated to be productive of the
most satisfactory results for power and speed, combined
with economy. There are certain characteristics common
to all good makers. The valve-motion is planned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>93</span>
to apply steam to the pistons at nearly boiler pressure,
with the means of cutting off early in the stroke, and
retaining the steam long enough in the cylinders to
obtain tangible benefits from its expansive principle.
Liberal heating-surface is provided in the boiler, its
extent being regulated by the size of the cylinders to
be supplied with steam. With a good valve-motion, and
plenty of heating-surface served with the products of
good coal, an engine must steam freely if it is not prevented
from doing so by malconstruction or adjustment
of minor parts, or by the wasting of heat in the boiler
or in the cylinders.</p>

<p>An engine of that kind will steam if it is managed
with any degree of skill. But as the best lathe ever
constructed will turn out poor work under the hands
of a blundering machinist, so the best of locomotives
will make a bad record when run without care or skill.
Regular feeding—the water supplied at a rate to equal
the quantity evaporated, which will maintain a nearly
level gauge—is an essential point in successful running.
It is hardly second in importance to skillful firing.</p>

<h3>CAUSES DETRIMENTAL TO MAKING STEAM.</h3>

<p>When an engine is steaming badly, almost the first
action of an experienced engineer is to examine the
petticoat-pipe. The influence which this pipe exercises
on the steaming qualities of an engine has already been
adverted to, but its importance can not be too strongly
urged upon the attention of the young engineer. It is
one of the most successful devices invented for regulating
the vacuum in the smoke-box, so that the currents
of hot gases shall flow evenly through all the flues.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>94</span>
Any thing which interferes to disturb the flow of these
currents, crowding them away from any section of the
flue-surface, will have a prejudicial effect upon the
steam. The pipe may be set too high to produce an
even draught, or the fault may be in the opposite direction.
Its diameter may not be suitable for the conditions
of smoke box and stack, or its shape may be at
fault. Not unfrequently the pipe is fastened obliquely,
so that the blast impinges on the side of the stack,
producing evil results; or the braces which keep it in
position occasionally break, and the draught is permitted
to shoot in every direction but the direct way
to the atmosphere, and the effect is immediately apparent
on the steam-gauge.</p>

<h3>PETTICOAT-PIPE.</h3>

<p>The petticoat-pipe performs, in relation to draught,
functions of a similar nature to those performed by the
tubes of an injector in inducing the flow of water; and
its efficiency is reduced by the same disturbing agencies.
The pipe must have a size in proportion to the diameter
of stack, and it must be set so that it shall deliver the
exhaust-steam to make a straight shoot through the
stack. When these conditions are properly arranged,
the exhaust-steam goes through the stack like a piston,
leaving a vacuum behind. The petticoat-pipe is a
device confined mainly to American locomotives; and
its purpose is to regulate the draught in the smoke-box
so that the currents of hot gases are drawn uniformly
through the flues, the top, bottom, and sides getting
about the same heating intensity as passes through the
middle rows. The opportunity for the exhibition of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>95</span>
good firing depends greatly upon the petticoat-pipe
being constructed properly, and secured at the right
position. It is impracticable to lay down a positive rule
for dimensions and best position of these pipes, for
engines of the same proportions frequently require different
petticoat-pipe arrangements to make them steam
freely. For our 17 × 24 engine, there is a petticoat-pipe
11½ inches in diameter, with a flare, at bottom, 17
inches wide. The pipe reaches within 3 inches of the
bottom of the stack, and is set one inch above the
nozzle. This gives good results in our case. When
engines with sufficient heating-surface do not steam
freely, the trouble nearly always lies in malproportioned
or badly set petticoat-pipes. Sometimes a very small
change in the position of this pipe will have a wonderful
effect upon the steaming qualities of the engine. If
the pipe is set too high, most of the draught will pass
through the lower flues; and the upper rows will become
filled with soot, and many of them are likely to get
choked with fine ashes, which remains there for want of
draught to force it out. Should it be too low, the bottom
rows of flues will suffer from the effect of defective
draught. When the petticoat-pipe is just right, the flues
will look uniformly clean inside, which can be ascertained
by a close inspection of the smoke-box. In addition to
making the engine lose the benefit of its full heating-surface,
a badly arranged petticoat-pipe concentrates the
draught so much that it tears the fire to pieces at one
particular point; and the only resource for the man who
wishes to keep up steam is to fire heavily, thereby preventing
cold air from being drawn through the crevices.
Many engines will not steam with a light fire, and yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>96</span>
do well with a heavy body of coal on the grates. In
nearly every instance of this kind, the fault lies in the
petticoat-pipe; and, if this is properly adjusted, the
engine will be found capable of carrying a light fire, and
will show far more economical results than could be
reached with heavy firing. Some engineers assume that
the petticoat-pipe must be right when an engine steams
freely, even though a heavy fire is necessary to produce
this result. This is a mistake. It may be badly set or
badly proportioned, only a degree smaller than it is
where the engine will not steam to keep the train going.
By closely watching the action of the blast on the fire
of an engine that calls for heavy firing, the engineer
learns where the fault lies. When the engine is laboring
on a hard pull, he should open the door; and if he
finds, that, in a particular section of the fire-box, the
smaller pieces of coal are dancing and glowing with an
incandescence more brilliant than the other parts, and
if he finds that this is repeatedly the case, he may conclude
that the nozzles are too small, or the petticoat-pipe
is working the mischief with his coal-account.
Should the nozzles be the proper size, he had better lose
no time in beginning to experiment with this pipe. He
can lower it a quarter of an inch at a time, and mark
the effects of the change on the fire. Should that produce
no improvement, he may try raising it; or, if there
is a movable sleeve on the top, that may be set in different
positions. An engineer can test a petticoat-pipe
much better by manipulating it on the road than in the
round-house. If no change of position will improve the
working of the pipe, one of different dimensions should
be tried. Perseverance in this line will bring the right<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>97</span>
thing in the end. I knew an engineer who tried five
different petticoat-pipes before the proper one was
reached. Such a thing causes labor, and needs patience;
but it pays when the fuel-account for running ten thousand
miles comes in.</p>

<h3>THE SMOKE-STACK.</h3>

<p>The ordinary purpose of the smoke-stack is to convey
the smoke and exhausted gases to the atmosphere. If
it is intended to perform its functions in a straightforward
manner, it is made about the same diameter as the
cylinders, and its highest altitude rises from 14 to 15
feet above the rail. The stack is a simple-enough
article to look at, yet a vast amount of inventive genius
has been expended upon attempts to expand its natural
functions. Attempts have been made to utilize it as an
apparatus for consuming smoke, and hundreds of patents
hang upon it as a spark-arrester. Patentees, in pushing
their hobby, seem occasionally to forget that a locomotive
requires some draught, as a means of generating
steam; and stacks are frequently so hampered with
patent spark-arresters that the means of making steam
are seriously curtailed. Were it not for the danger of
raising fires by spark-throwing, it would be more economical
to use engines with clear smoke-stacks; and
the extended front end, with open stack, is a good move
in this direction.</p>

<h3>OBSTRUCTIONS TO DRAUGHT.</h3>

<p>Every obstruction to free draught entails the use of
strong artificial means to overcome it. The usual resort
is contracted nozzles, which induce a sharp blast, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>98</span>
use up more fuel than would be required with an open
passage to the atmosphere. Among the obstacles
to free steaming, that come under the category of
obstructed draught, may be placed a wide cone fastened
low, and netting with fine meshes. When the draught
passage is interrupted to a pernicious extent by spark-arresting
appliances, their effects can be perceived on
the fire when steam is shut off; for the flame and smoke
prefer the fire-box door to the stack as a means of exit.
Sometimes steam-making is hindered by the netting
getting gummed up with spent lubricants and dirt from
the cylinders. Cases occur where this gum has to be
burned off before free draught can be obtained. Waste
soaked with coal-oil will generally burn off the objectionable
coating.</p>

<h3>CHOKING THE NETTING WITH OIL.</h3>

<p>Gumming of the netting is usually caused by carelessness
in oiling the valves. Some runners will shut
off for a minute while the fireman oils the valves, and
the lubricant scarcely gets time to reach the steam-chest
when the throttle is opened wide again; and
instead of soaking over valves and cylinders, and into
the remotest part of piston-packing, the oil goes through
the stack with the first puff of steam. It is best, in
oiling the valves, to leave the cup-plugs open long
enough for the oil to be sucked out of the pipes. Then,
when steam is applied, it should be done by slightly
opening the throttle, so that it will work the oil into
the piston-packing; and, after a few turns run this way,
there will be no loose oil left to defile the netting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>99</span></p>

<h3>SILICIOUS DEPOSIT ON FLUE-SHEET.</h3>

<p>Certain kinds of coal deposit a hard, silicious substance
upon the back flue-sheet, which gradually accumulates
till the draught is seriously impeded. This, of
course, prevents the full benefit of the hot gases being
obtained; and consequently the steam goes down.
Flues stopped up with cinders produce a similar effect.
The flues getting choked up with cinders is not always
an indication that the petticoat-pipe is performing its
duty improperly. Stopping up of flues is often caused
by wild, unskillful firing. A shovelful of coal pitched
high, deposits part of its load direct in the flues; and
some pieces that are a close fit do not go through.
They stick half way; and small cinders soon follow,
that quickly close up the entire passage.</p>

<h3>THE EXTENDED SMOKE-BOX.</h3>

<p>By this arrangement, the spark-arresting device is
transferred from the smoke-stack to the smoke-box, and
the exhaust steam escapes direct to the atmosphere,
without meeting obstruction from a cone or netting.
The netting is generally an oblong screen, extending
from above the upper row of flues to the top of the
extended smoke-box, some distance ahead of the stack.
This presents a wide area of netting for the fire-gases
to pass through. The draught through the flues is regulated
by an apron or diaphragm-plate, extending downwards
at an acute angle from the upper part of the flue-sheet.
With the long exhaust-pipe used with the
extended smoke-box, the tendency of the exhaust is to
draw the fire-gases through the upper row of flues.
The diaphragm-plate performs the same duties here, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>100</span>
regulating the draught through the flues equally, as the
petticoat-pipe does with the diamond-stack. It is of
great consequence, for the successful working of the
engine, that the draught should be properly regulated:
otherwise there will be trouble for want of steam.</p>

<p>When an engine having an extended smoke-box does
not steam properly, experiments should be made with
the diaphragm fastened at different angles, till the point
is reached where equal draught through the flues is
obtained. Closing the nozzles, as a means of improving
the steaming of such an engine, is certain to make
matters worse.</p>

<h3>STEAM-PIPES LEAKING.</h3>

<p>The blowing of steam-pipe joints in the smoke-box is
very disastrous to the steaming qualities of a locomotive.
This has a double action against keeping up steam.
All that escapes by leaking is so much wasted, and its
presence in the smoke-box interrupts the draught.</p>

<p>If the steam-pipe joints are leaking badly, they can
be heard when the fire-door is open and the engine
working steam. Some experienced engineers can detect
the action of leaky steam-pipe joints on the fire; but
the safest way to locate this trouble is by opening the
smoke-box door, and giving the engine steam.</p>

<h3>DEFECTS OF GRATES.</h3>

<p>Grates that are fitted so close as to curtail the free
admission of air below the fire prevent an engine from
steaming freely. The effect of this will be most apparent
when the fire begins to get dirty. This is not a
common fault. I once knew of an engine’s steaming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>101</span>
being very seriously impaired by two or three fingers
in one section of grate being broken off. The engine
steamed well with a light fire, till, in dumping the fire
at the end of a journey, the men knocked some of the
fingers off. Next trip, it seemed a different engine.
Nothing but heavy firing would keep up an approach at
working-pressure. I experimented with the petticoat-pipe
without satisfaction, assured myself that no leaks
existed among the pipes; the stack, with its connections,
was faultless; and the engineer was puzzled. The
defect was discovered by watching the effect of the
blast upon the fire. Signs of air-drawing were often to
be seen at the point where the broken fingers were.
This was where the mischief lay. Too much cold air
came through, unless the opening were bedded over by
heavy fire.</p>

<p>A drop-grate that did not close properly had a similar
effect upon another engine which came under the
author’s notice; and a change, which shut the opening,
effected a perfect remedy.</p>

<h3>LIME, SCALE, AND MUD.</h3>

<p>In calcareous regions, where the water-supply for locomotives
is drawn from wells, the most common cause
for bad-steaming engines is leaky heating-surfaces, or
water-surfaces incrusted with lime deposits. When he
sees water pouring from flues and stay-bolts, an engineer
has no difficulty in divining the reason why his engine
steams poorly; nor need he be far-seeing to perceive
a remedy in the boiler-maker’s calking-tools skillfully
applied. The case of incrustation is, however, more
difficult to comprehend in all its bearings. When water<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>102</span>
containing lime-salts touches the hot flues or fire-box,
evaporation takes place; and the solid substance previously
in solution is left behind, and adheres to the
heating-surfaces, gradually forming a refractory scale
which is an indifferent conductor of heat. As this
scale becomes thick, it stands up, like a non-conducting
barrier, between the water and the hot sheets; and it
takes a much greater expenditure of heat to evaporate
the water inside, just as a kettle coated with scale is
much harder to boil than a clean one. When a boiler
gets badly fouled with scale and mud, these impurities
exercise a pernicious effect upon the steaming qualities
of a locomotive.</p>

<h3>PREVENTING ACCUMULATION OF MUD IN BOILERS.</h3>

<p>Mud-drums, with blow-off cocks attached, serve to
check the growth of this evil when the engineer is
careful to make frequent use of these appliances; and
a strong pressure of washing-out water, poured frequently
through the boiler, has an excellent cleansing
effect: but some kinds of scale defy mud-drums and
the best methods of washing out, leaving the only resort
to be the removal of flues for cleansing. The
filling up of a boiler with scale and mud, so as to prevent
the engine from steaming freely, is necessarily a
gradual process; and an observant engineer has time to
note the change, and recommend the proper remedy.</p>

<h3>TEMPORARY CURES FOR LEAKY FLUES.</h3>

<p>Leaky flues or stay-bolts may sometimes be dried up
temporarily by putting bran, or any other substance
containing starch, in the feed-water. Care must be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>103</span>
taken not to use this remedy too liberally, or it will
cause foaming. It is, however, a sort of granger resort,
and is seldom tried except to help an engine to
the nearest point where calking can be done.</p>

<h3>GOOD MANAGEMENT MAKES ENGINES STEAM.</h3>

<p>No engine steams so freely but that it will get short
under mismanagement. The locomotive is designed to
generate steam from water kept at a nearly uniform
temperature. If an engine is pulling a train which
requires the evaporation of 1,500 gallons of water each
hour, there will be 25 gallons pumped into the boiler
every minute. When this goes on regularly, all goes
well; but if the runner shuts the feed for five minutes,
and then opens it to allow 50 gallons a minute to pass
through the pump, the best engine going will show
signs of distress. Where this fluctuating style of
feeding is indulged in,—and many careless runners are
habitually guilty of such practices,—no locomotive can
retain the reputation of doing its work economically.</p>

<h3>INTERMITTENT BOILER-FEEDING.</h3>

<p>The case of Fred Bemis, who still murders locomotives
on a road in Indiana, is instructive in this respect.
Fred was originally a butcher; and, had he stuck to the
cleaver, he might have passed through life as a fairly
intelligent man. But he was seized with the ambition
to go railroading, and struck a job as fireman. He
never displayed any aptitude for the business, and was
a poor fireman all his time through sheer indifference.
But he had no specially bad habits; and, in the course
of years, he was “set up.” He had the aptitude for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>104</span>
seeing a thing done a thousand times without learning
how to do it. All his movements with an engine were
spasmodic. Starting from a station with a roaring fire
and full boiler, the next stopping-point loomed ahead;
and to get there as soon as possible was his only
thought. He would keep the reverse-lever in the
neighborhood of the “corner,” and pound the engine
along. The pump would be shut off to keep the steam
from going back too fast, till the water became low:
then the feed would be opened wide, and the steam
drowned down. In vain a heavy fire would be torn to
pieces by vigorous shaking of the grates. The steam
would not rally, and he would crawl into the next station
at a wagon pace. A laboring blower and shaker-bar
would resuscitate the energies of the engine in a
few minutes if the flues and fire-box were not leaking
too badly, and the injector would provide the water for
starting on; but no experience of delay and trouble
seemed capable of teaching Bemis the lesson how to
work the engine properly. He soon became the terror
of train men, and the boiler-makers worked incessantly
on his fire-box. But he is still there, although he will
not make an engineer if he runs for a century.</p>

<h3>TOO MUCH PISTON CLEARANCE.</h3>

<p>On one of our leading railroads a locomotive was
rebuilt, and fitted with the extension smoke-box, which
was an experiment for that road, and consequently was
looked upon with some degree of distrust. When the
engine was put on the road, it was found that it did
not steam satisfactorily. Of course, it was at once concluded
that the draught arrangements were to blame;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>105</span>
and experiments were made, with the view of adjusting
the flow of gases through the tubes to produce better
results. The traveling engineer of the road had charge
of the job, and he proceeded industriously to work at
locating the trouble. He tried every thing in the way
of adjusting the smoke-box attachments that could be
thought of, but nothing that was done improved the
steaming qualities of the engine. He then proceeded
to search for trouble in some other direction. The
result of his examination was the discovery that the
engine was working with three-fourth inch clearance at
each end of the cylinders. This, he naturally concluded,
entailed a serious waste of steam; so he had the clearance
reduced to one-fourth inch. When the engine got
out after this change, it steamed very satisfactorily;
and the extension smoke-box is no longer in disrepute
on that road.</p>

<h3>BADLY PROPORTIONED SMOKE-STACKS.</h3>

<p>Mistakes are frequently made when the open stack
is adopted, as is practicable with the extended smoke-box,
of making the stack too wide for the exhaust.
This leads to deficiency of draught for the steam that is
passing through the stack, because the steam does not
fill the stack like a piston creating a clean vacuum
behind it. Where an engine fails to steam freely after
being equipped with an extended smoke-box, attention
should be directed to the proportion of stack diameter
to the size of cylinders.</p>

<h3>THE EXHAUST NOZZLES.</h3>

<p>Locomotives, with their limited heating-surface, require<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>106</span>
intense artificial draught to produce steam rapidly.
Many devices have been tried to stimulate combustion,
and generate the necessary heat; but none have proved
so effectual and reliable as contracted exhaust orifices.
As the intermittent rush of steam from the cylinders
to the open atmosphere escapes from the contracted
openings of the exhaust-pipe, it leaves a partial vacuum
in the smoke-box, into which the gases from the fire-box
flow with amazing velocity. As the area of the
exhaust nozzles is increased, the pressure of steam passing
through becomes lessened, and the height of the
vacuum in the smoke-box is decreased. Consequently,
with wide nozzles, the velocity of the gases through
the flues is slower than with narrow ones; for there
is less suction in the smoke-box to draw out the fire
products: and, where the gases pass slowly through the
flues, there is more time given for the water to abstract
the heat. Any change or arrangement which will retain
the gases of combustion one-tenth of a second longer in
contact with the heat-extracting surfaces, will wonderfully
increase the evaporative service of a ton of coal.
Experiments with the pyrometer, an instrument for
measuring high temperatures, have shown that the gases
passing through the smoke-box vary from 400 degrees up
to 900 degrees Fahrenheit; and they show that increase
of smoke-box temperature keeps pace with contracted
nozzles. From this, engineers can understand why lead
gaskets do not keep blower-joints in a smoke-box tight,
the melting-point of lead being 627 degrees.</p>

<p>Inordinately contracted nozzles are objectionable in
another way. They cause back pressure in the cylinders,
and thereby decrease the effective duty of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>107</span>
steam. Double nozzles are preferable to single ones;
because with the latter the steam has a tendency to
shoot over into the other cylinder, and cause back
pressure.</p>

<p>Engineers anxious to make a good record, try to run
with nozzles as wide as possible. Contracted nozzles
destroy power by back pressure: they tear the fire to
pieces with the violent blast, and they hurry the heat
through the flues so fast that its temperature is but
slightly diminished when it passes into the atmosphere.
The engineer, who, by intelligent care, reduces
his smoke-box temperature 100 degrees, is worthy to
rank as a master in his calling.</p>

<p>The other day an engineer came into the round-house,
and said, “You had better put 3½ inch nozzles in my
engine: I think she will get along with that increase of
size.” He had been using 3¼ inch nozzles. The
change was accordingly made. When he returned from
the next trip, he expressed a doubt about the advantage
of the change. But it happened that his own fireman
was off, and a strange man was sent out, who, although
a good fireman, failed to keep up steam satisfactorily.
On the following trip, however, the fireman who belonged
to the engine, returned, and found no difficulty in
getting all the steam required. But this fireman is one
who would stand far up among a thousand competitors.
Considerable practice and intelligent thoughtfulness,
combined with unfailing industry, have developed in
this man an excellence in fire management seldom
attained. He follows a unique system, which seems his
own. It is the method of firing light carried to perfection.
His coal is all broken down fine, and lies within<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>108</span>
easy reach. His movements are cool and deliberate,
no hurry, no fuss. When he opens the door, his loaded
shovel is ready to deposit its cargo over the spot which
a glance shows him to be the thinnest portion of the
fire. On the parts of the run where the most steam is
needed, he fires one shovelful at brief intervals, keeping
it up right along. In this way the steam never feels
the cooling effect of fresh fire, for the contents of the
fire-box are kept nearly uniform. This plan is a near
approach to the automatic stoker which mechanical
visionaries predict will effect perfect firing in the vague
future. To follow out such a system requires perseverance
and self-denial, but these are well rewarded to the
man whose work is his pride.</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>SHORTNESS OF WATER.—PUMP DISORDERS.</i></span>
</h2>
</div>

<h3>TROUBLE DEVELOPS NATURAL ENERGY.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Trouble</span> and affliction are known to have a purifying
and elevating effect upon human character; difficulties
encountered in the execution of work, develop the skill
of the true artisan; and trouble on the road, or accidents
to locomotives, furnish the engineer with opportunities
for developing natural energy, ingenuity, and
perseverance, if these attributes are in him, or they
publish to his employers his lack of these important
qualities.</p>

<p>One of the most serious sources of trouble that an
engineer can meet with on the road, is shortness of
water.</p>

<h3>SHORTNESS OF WATER A SERIOUS PREDICAMENT.</h3>

<p>Deficiency of steam with a locomotive that is expected
to get a train along on time, is a very trying
condition for an engineer to endure. But a more trying
and more dangerous ordeal, is want of water.
Where steam is employed as a means of applying
power, water must be kept constantly over the heating-surfaces
while the fire is incandescent, or their destruction
is inevitable. With a boiler which evaporates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>110</span>
water rapidly, and in such large quantities as that of
the locomotive, the most perfect feeding apparatus is
necessary. Nearly all locomotives are well supplied in
this respect. Good pumps or efficient injectors provide
the engineer with excellent appliances for feeding
the boiler under ordinary circumstances. But conditions
sometimes occur where the best of pumps, or the
most reliable of injectors, fail to force water into the
boiler.</p>

<h3>HOW TO DEAL WITH SHORTNESS OF WATER.</h3>

<p>When from any cause he finds the boiler getting
short of water, the engineer should resort to all known
methods within his power to overcome the difficulty, by
removing the obstacle that is preventing the feeding
apparatus from operating. But, while doing so, the
safety of his fire-box and flues should not be overlooked
for a moment. The utmost care must be taken to
quench the fire before the water gets below the crown-sheet.
This can be performed most effectually by
knocking the fire out; but sometimes the temporary
increase of heat, occasioned by the act of drawing the
fire, is undesirable; and, in such a case, the safest plan
is to dampen the fire by throwing wet earth, or fine
coal saturated with water, upon it. Or a more urgent
case still may intervene, when drenching the fire with
water is the only means of saving the sheets from destruction.
This should be a last resort, however; for it
is a very clumsy way of saving the fire-box, and is liable
to do no small amount of mischief. Cold water thrown
upon hot steel sheets, causes such sudden contraction,
that cracks, or even rupture, may ensue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>111</span></p>

<h3>WATCHING THE WATER-GAUGES.</h3>

<p>As “burning his engine” is the greatest disgrace that
can professionally befall an engineer, every man worthy
of the name guards against a possibility of being caught
short of water unawares, by frequent testing of the
gauge-cocks. It is not enough to have a good-working
water-glass. If an engineer is ambitious to avoid trouble,
he runs by the gauge-cocks, using the glass as an
auxiliary. Careful experiments have demonstrated the
fact, that the water-glass, working properly, is a more
certain indication of the water-level than gauge-cocks;
for, when the boiler is dirty, the water rises above its
natural level, and rushes at the open gauge-cock. This
can be proved when water is just below a gauge-cock
level. If the cock is opened slightly, steam alone passes
out; but, when the full opening is made, water comes.
But water will not come through a gauge-cock, unless
the water-level is in its proximity; and an engineer can
tell, when his gauge shows a mixture of steam, that the
water shown is not to be relied upon. It is not “solid.”
On the other hand, a water-glass out of order sometimes
shows a full head of water when the crown-sheet
is red-hot.</p>

<h3>WHAT TO DO WHEN THE TENDER IS FOUND EMPTY BETWEEN
STATIONS.</h3>

<p>The most natural cause for pumps or injectors ceasing
to work, is absence of water from the tender. This
condition comes round on the road occasionally, where
engineers neglect to fill up at water-stations, or where
there are long runs between points of water-supply.
When an engineer finds himself short of water, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>112</span>
means of replenishing his tank too distant to reach,
even with the empty engine, he should bank or smother
the fire, and retain sufficient water in the boiler to raise
steam on when he has been assisted to the nearest
water-tank. This will save tedious delay, especially
where an engine has no pumps. Occasionally, from
miscalculations or through accidents, the fire has to be
quenched, and insufficient water is left in the boiler to
start a fire on safely. In this event, buckets can be
resorted to, and the boiler filled at the safety-valves,
should there be no assistance, or means of pumping up.
Every possible means should be exhausted to get the
engine in steam, before a runner requests to have his
engine towed in cold.</p>

<h3>A TRYING POSITION.</h3>

<p>I once knew a case where an engineer inadvertently
passed a water-tank without filling his tender. He had
a heavy train, and was pushing along with a heavy fire,
on a severe, frosty night, when every creek and slough
by the wayside was lost in heavy ice. Presently his
pump stopped working, and he spent some time trying
to start it before he discovered that the tender was
empty. By the time this fact became known, his boiler-water
was low, and a heavy fire kept the steam screaming
at the safety-valves. He had no dump-grate, and
the fire was too heavy to draw. It seemed a clear case
of destroying the fire-box and flues. But he was a man
of many resources. First, he tried to get water through
the gauge-cock—he had only one gauge—to quench
the fire, but found the plan would not work. Then he
filled up the fire-box nearly to the crown-sheet with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>113</span>
smallest coal on the tender, and partly smothered the
fire. He then partly opened the smoke-box door, and
started for the water-station. After getting the engine
going, he hooked the reverse-lever in the center, and
kept the throttle wide open, to make the most of the
steam-supply. He saved his engine.</p>

<h3>WATCHING THE STRAINERS.</h3>

<p>When the top of a tank is in bad order, and permits
cinders and small pieces of coal to fall through rivet-holes,
or through seams, the engineer may look out for
grief with his pumps or injectors. On the first signs of
the water failing, he should examine the strainers; and
he will probably find that these copper perforations,
which stand like wardens guarding the safety of the
pumps and injectors, have accumulated a mass of cinders
that obstructs the flow of the water.</p>

<h3>CARE OF PUMPS.</h3>

<p>Mechanical prognostications seem to indicate that
pumps, as locomotive attachments, have outgrown their
usefulness, and that their days are numbered. They
have done good service while no better method of feeding
locomotive boilers was known; but, since the advent
of injectors, pumps have begun to disappear. They still
hold their own, however, on a great many roads; and
a description of their management will be of general
interest.</p>

<h3>HOW THE CONDITION OF PUMPS CAN BE TESTED.</h3>

<p>If an engineer is in the habit of pumping regularly,
and of watching his engine closely, he can tell immediately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>114</span>
from the steam when the pump stops working.
Then he will open the pet-cock; and its action will indicate,
to some extent, where the trouble lies. If the
pet-cock throws a feeble stream of water, the trouble
probably is in the lower valve. If that sticks up, or
part of the bottom cage breaks, the plunger will push
the water back into the feed-pipe on the return stroke,
consequently there will be no pressure to throw a strong
stream through the pet-cock. When the upper or pressure-valve
is damaged, or is stuck up, the pet-cock will
throw a full stream during the inward stroke of the
plunger; but, on the outward stroke, the plunger will
draw the water out of the branch-pipe, and air will be
sucked in at the open pet-cock. When the check-valve
is damaged, or stuck up, steam and water will blow back
through the branch-pipe when the pet-cock is left open.
If the steam thus escaping from the check-valves heats
the pump and valves to a high temperature, it will be
prevented from working, from several causes. The heat
generates a low form of steam, which fills up the space
behind the plunger; therefore, no vacuum is formed to
draw the water. Not infrequently the pump-valves expand
so much from the heat, that they stick fast away
from their seats. If the pump has stopped through the
presence of impurities on either of the valves or cages,
the engineer knows that he may remove the obstruction
by steam-pressure; so, after letting the feed-pipe fill
with water, he opens the heater-cock, and closes the
foot-cock, letting the steam and water blow through
the pump. If he considers the obstruction to be in the
strainer, and has not time to stop and take it down, he
blows steam from the heater through to the tender,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>115</span>
which gives temporary relief. If any of the pump-valves
are stuck up, and can not be got back to their seats by
blowing water and steam through them, the engineer
will take a soft hammer, and tap the seats lightly, with
good prospects of remedying the defect. In case no
improvement can be effected in that way, and there is
no other feeding-medium to rely upon, the engineer can
take down the top or bottom chamber in a few minutes
to remove any impurities that may be keeping the pump
from working. He will then be likely to find a piece of
packing that has passed through the pump, bushing, or
some other foreign substance, jammed between the cage
and the valve, keeping the latter immovable. Or the
trouble may be a broken valve or cage, which will render
the pump useless till repaired.</p>

<h3>LIFT OF PUMP-VALVES.</h3>

<p>When a pump-valve has much lift, it is very liable to
pound itself or the cage so heavily that breakage occurs.
The proper lift required for pump-valves depends
to some extent upon the diameter of the valves themselves,
those of liberal thickness requiring less lift than
a valve of narrow compass. The engine pulling our
train has pump-valves two and one-half inches in diameter:
the pump-plunger, being worked from the cross-head,
has a diameter of two inches. The bottom valve
has three-thirty-seconds of an inch of lift, the middle
valve has one-eighth of an inch of lift, and the check-valve
rises one-fourth of an inch. These dimensions produce
very satisfactory results for all speeds. The pump performs
its work with remarkable smoothness, is free from
pounding or fluctuating, and gives no trouble about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>116</span>
repairs. Engines employed on fast passenger service
have their valve-lifts one-thirty-second of an inch less
than this one, and slow freight engines are regulated
to rise one-sixteenth of an inch more than the dimensions
given.</p>

<h3>KEEP PIPES TIGHT, AND PACKING IN ORDER.</h3>

<p>In order to insure the regular and satisfactory working
of a pump, care should be taken to prevent leaks
about the feed-pipes or heater-pipes: the packing should
be kept in good order, and the chamber-joints should be
perfectly air-tight. During the outward stroke of the
plunger, a vacuum should be produced inside the pump,
into which the water rushes. If this vacuum gets partly
filled with air or vapor, the working of the pump will be
unsatisfactory. Nothing is so liable to produce this
undesirable condition as badly packed glands or leaky
joints. A poor pump can often be made to produce
fair work, by attention and care bestowed upon its
attachment; and lack of care will soon render the best-constructed
pump unreliable.</p>

<h3>SAND IN THE PUMP-CHAMBERS.</h3>

<p>The pump has one arch-enemy, which comes off victor
in every conflict. That is sand. The railway idiom
which uses the word “sand” to express courage, originated
in the knowledge of how certainly and quickly a
handful of sand would vanquish the best pump that mechanical
skill might produce. The grit works its way
among the packing, and tears and cuts the plunger out
of shape: it insinuates itself up between the cages and
valves, and holds the latter so fast that hard hammering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>117</span>
is often needed to dissolve the compact. Proper washing
out of the tank, cleansing of feed-pipes, and the use
of water free from sand, is the only sure remedy for this
evil. Where an engineer is situated so that he must take
water containing sand in suspension, partial relief will
be obtained by giving the valves free side-room in the
cages; but an injector will be found much superior to a
pump as a means of putting sand-contaminated water
into a boiler.</p>

<h3>DELIVERY ORIFICE CHOKED WITH LIME SEDIMENT.</h3>

<p>When a pump begins to show distress from over-pressure,—which
will be indicated by the breaking out
of joints, the rejection of stuffing and box-packing, and
the bursting of branch-pipe,—the orifice between the
check and the boiler should be examined; for that
aperture often becomes almost closed by the accumulation
of lime-salts.</p>

<h3>MINOR PUMP TROUBLES.</h3>

<p>Where the feed-pipes and other connections are perfectly
air-tight, some pumps will pound badly when the
water is shut off. This can be prevented by making a
minute hole in the feed-pipe; or a more convenient
place is the upper part of the heater-pipe, away above
the water-level.</p>

<p>Should the valves of a pump be leaky on their seats,
the pump will not work satisfactorily. Where the lower
valve is not properly ground on the seat, the plunger
sucks air from the feed-pipe, or through the joints or
packing, and, at the return stroke, compresses part of
the air in the pump, and forces the remainder back into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>118</span>
the feed-pipe through the leaky valve. This process
goes on after the feed is put on; the accumulated air
stands like a cushion between the plunger and the
water; and the pump will not go to work until the pet-cock
is opened, when the air rushes out, permitting the
water to flow in. Engineers having pumps that will
not work till the pet-cock is opened, should have the
suction-valve ground in; and they will find a decided
improvement from the operation.</p>

<p>For slow train service, pumps perform the service of
boiler-feeding fairly well; but, for fast passenger trains,
a pump should not be tolerated. A pump can not be
constructed for high-speed engines that will throw
water regularly at high velocity of stroke.</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>INJECTORS.</i></span>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">Injectors</span> have made remarkably rapid strides into
public favor during the last ten years. It is a safe prediction
to say, that, before the end of another decade,
there will be no new pumps put upon locomotives. So
long as injectors were imperfectly understood, and were
used with no regularity, they retained the name of being
unreliable; but, so soon as they began to be made the
sole feeding-medium for locomotive boilers, they had to
be worked regularly, and kept in order, which quickly
made their merits recognized.</p>

<h3>INVENTION OF THE INJECTOR.</h3>

<p>The feed injector was invented by Henri Giffard, an
eminent French scientist and æronaut. Its successful
action was discovered during a series of experiments
made with the view of devising light machinery that
might be used to propel balloons. Although Giffard
designed the most perfect balloon that was ever constructed,
the injector was not used upon it; and the invention
was laid aside, and almost forgotten. During
the course of a sea-voyage, Giffard happened to meet
Stewart of the engineering firm, Sharp, Stewart, &amp; Co.,
of Manchester, England. In the course of a conversation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>120</span>
on the feeding of boilers, Giffard remembered his
injector, and mentioned its method of action. Stewart
was struck with the simplicity of the device, and undertook
to bring it out in England, which he shortly afterwards
did, representing the interests of the inventor so
long as the original patents lasted. By his advice, William
Sellers &amp; Co. of Philadelphia were given control
of the American patents.</p>

<p>Seldom has an invention caused so much astonishment
and wild speculation among mechanics, and even
among scientists, as the injector did for the first few
years of its use. Scientists were not long in discovering
the philosophy of the injector’s action, but that
knowledge spread more slowly among mechanics. It
was regarded as a case of perpetual motion,—the means
of doing work without power, or, as Americans expressed
it, by the same means a man could raise himself
by pulling on his boot-straps.</p>

<h3>TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW THE INJECTOR WORKED.</h3>

<p>Among the mechanics I associated with, the injector
was spoken of as a machine having a secret method of
action. There was supposed to be some part inside,
where a vacuum was formed, which sent the water into
the boiler. We were all familiar with the vacuum of
condensing engines, and it was a convenient solution
of the mystery. I remember committing what we regarded
as a heinous sin, in trying to find out the secret
of the injector. On a Sunday forenoon in a Scotch
town, where it was considered next to a crime to miss
going to church, three of us stole quietly into an engine-house,
and took an injector apart, when we knew the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>121</span>
foreman, like a pious man, was listening to the sermon.
All our plans had been laid the previous day, and the
necessary tools laid conveniently at hand. The feeling
of disappointment we experienced at finding nothing to
explain the working of the thing, is still vivid in my
memory.</p>

<h3>THE PRINCIPLE OF THE INJECTOR’S ACTION.</h3>

<p>The principle of the injector’s action is that of induced
currents, which is much more popularly understood
to-day than it was twenty-five years ago. A
current of any kind has a tendency to induce a movement
in the same direction of any body it passes over
or touches. Thus, we are all familiar with the fact that
a current of air called wind, passing over the surface of
a body of water, sets waves in motion, and dashes the
water high up on the shore above its original level. In
the same way, a jet of steam moving very rapidly, when
injected into a body of water under favorable conditions,
imparts a portion of its motion, and starts momentum
sufficient to overcome the original pressure of the
steam. That is how the injector is made to force water
into a boiler against the same pressure the steam is
starting from. The principle is now utilized in the arts
for many useful purposes. The ordinary locomotive
blast, blowers, steam siphons, steam-jets, jet exhausters,
and argand burners, are common instances of its application.</p>

<p>When the action of the injector is closely examined,
its mystery as a source of power disappears; for it is
found that an amount of heat equal to the mechanical
equivalent of work done, is used up during the operation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>122</span>
of feeding. Thus, when a given quantity of heat units
pass from the throttle to work the injector, the whole
of the heat does not return to the boiler along with the
feed-water, as was first supposed to be the case; but a
portion of heat representing the foot pounds of work
done is dissipated, besides other losses incident to leakage,
radiation, and convection.</p>

<h3>DIFFERENT FORMS OF INJECTOR.</h3>

<p>There are a great many different forms of injectors
in use, but all of them conform to certain elementary
principles in their mode of action. Steam passes from
the boiler through the steam-pipe and receiving-tube <i>A</i>
(<a href="#i_1">Fig. 1</a>) at a high velocity, and, combining with the
water at the point <i>B</i>, condenses, but imparts considerable
momentum to the water, which rushes along into
the delivery pipe, raises the check-valve, and passes
into the boiler.</p>

<div id="i_1" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img src="images/i_p122.png" width="443" height="176" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span></div></div>

<p>The tubes of the injector are arranged so that a concentrated
jet of steam shall impinge upon the water to
force it through passages that are designed in the best
form for maintaining the solidity of the current. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>123</span>
speed imparted to the water represents the work performed
by the steam, and upon this velocity depends
the successful action of the injector. As the current
of water for starting the injector could not be induced
against the constant pressure on the check-valve, which
equals the pressure at the throttle, an overflow is provided
where the water can flow unchecked till the necessary
momentum is obtained, when the overflow is
closed. All deviations in construction from the elementary
injector shown in <a href="#i_1">Fig. 1</a> are made for the purpose
of extending the action of the injector under varied
conditions, for making it work automatically under different
pressures of steam, and for improving its capacity
to lift water above its natural level.</p>

<h3>A HEATER-PIPE ACTING AS AN INJECTOR.</h3>

<p>Before the invention of the injector, cases occasionally
happened of the heater-pipe acting as an injector.
Where the end of the heater pipe was carried through
the feed-pipe, and pointed towards the check-valve,
starting the heater under favorable conditions would
carry the water into the boiler. A great many old engineers
relate instances where this has happened.</p>

<h3>SKILL AND REFLECTION NEEDED IN REPAIRING INJECTORS.</h3>

<p>Injectors can be kept in good order with less work
than is needed to keep a pump going, but the highest
kind of mechanical skill is required for the injector
when repairs must be done. Almost any kind of machinist
can fit a new chamber or plunger into a pump.
Many men who will do this job satisfactorily will get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>124</span>
badly left when they try to put a defective injector in
order. To do such work, thoughtful reflection is called
for, besides the hand that can do accurate fitting. A
workman who may be good on guides or cross-heads or
links, takes an injector apart that will not work, and
can perceive nothing wrong with it, because he has not
got the philosophy of the thing through his head; and
he must have that before he can have insight into the
probable cause of derangement.</p>

<h3>CARE OF INJECTORS.</h3>

<p>When an engineer finds that an injector refuses to
work, his first resort should be the strainer. That gets
choked with cinders or other impurities so frequently,
that no time should be lost in examining it. One day,
when I was running a round-house, an engineer came
in breathless, with the information that his engine was
blocked in the yard, and he must dump his fire, as he
could not get his injector to work. The thermometer
stood at twenty degrees below zero, and an Iowa blizzard
was blowing; so the prospect of a dead engine in
the yard meant some distressingly cold labor. I asked,
the first thing, if he had tried the strainer; and his answer
was, that the strainer was all right, for the injector
primed satisfactorily, but broke every time he put on a
head of steam. I went out to the engine, and had the
engineer try to work the injector. By watching the
overflow stream, I easily perceived that the injector
was not getting enough water, although it primed.
An examination showed that the strainer was full of
cinders, and the injector went to work all right when
the obstruction to the water was removed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>125</span></p>

<h3>THE MOST COMMON CAUSES OF DERANGEMENT.</h3>

<p>Sand and cinders are the greatest cause of failures
with injectors; as they are, indeed, with all water-feeding
apparatus. I knew a case where water for a locomotive,
running on a short branch, was taken out of a
sandy creek with a siphon. The tank had generally
about six inches of sand in the bottom. The engine
had a pump and an injector; but all the feeding had to
be done by the latter, for the pump never worked a gallon
of water. The injector worked the water through
when it seemed a quarter sand. In a short time the sand
destroyed the tubes of the injector, for it acted on them
the same way as a sand-blast does in cutting files or glass.</p>

<p>A very common cause of failure of injectors, is leakage
of steam through throttle-valve or check-valve,
keeping the injector so hot that no vacuum can be
formed to make it prime. A great many injector-checks
have been turned out too light for ordinary service,
while others are made in a shape that will always leave
the valve away from the seat when they stop working.
Then the engineer has to run forward, and pound the
check with a hammer to keep the steam from blowing
back; and that soon ruins the casting. Check-valves
set in a horizontal position are worthless with water
that contains grit.</p>

<h3>HOW TO KEEP AN INJECTOR IN GOOD ORDER.</h3>

<p>To preserve a good working injector, the engineer
should see that all the pipes and joints are kept perfectly
tight. It is hard to keep pipes and joints tight
when they are subjected to the continual jars a locomotive
must stand; but injectors can not be depended on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>126</span>
where there is a possibility of air mixing with the water.
Leaky joints or pipes are particularly troublesome to
lifting injectors; for air passes in, and keeps the steam-jet
from forming a vacuum. At first the injector will
merely be difficult to start; but, as the leaks get worse,
there will be no starting it at all. Then, the air mixing
with the water is detrimental to the working of all
injectors, as its tendency is to decrease the speed of the
water. The compact molecules of water form a cohesive
body, which the steam can strike upon with telling
force to keep it in motion. When the water is mixed
with air, it lacks the element of compactness; and the
steam-jet strikes a semi-elastic body, which does not
receive momentum readily. This mixture of steam and
air does not act solidly on the check-valve, but makes
the water pass in with a bubbling sound, as if the valve
were moving up and down; and the stream of water
breaks very readily when it is working in this way.</p>

<h3>CURIOUS CASES OF TROUBLE WITH AN INJECTOR.</h3>

<p>I ran a Sellers improved injector on a locomotive
about a year, and it was an excellent feeding apparatus;
but I several times had curious cases of trouble in getting
it to work. Once it began drawing air; and I could
not find out where the air was coming from, for the
pipes seemed all tight. But the air was going through,
for I could hear its mutterings; and the water kept
breaking, which was an annoyance on the road. A
heater-pipe was attached to the injector feed-pipe; and
I afterward found out that the air was getting in at the
top joint of this pipe, which did not show a leak, being
above the water.</p>

<p>Another time I had almost a failure with this injector<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>127</span>
out in the snow. I was out with a snow-plow, opening
the road through enormously deep snow-drifts. We had
worked on one bank for several days; and we made
water by shoveling snow into the tank, which was
melted by blowing steam through the heaters and
injector. Cinders were passed into the tank very freely
with the snow, and presently I began to have trouble
with my injector. I took it apart several times, and
cleaned out cinders, when it went to work all right again.
But a time came when it refused to work when there
were no cinders inside, and it seemed that no amount of
coaxing would make it start. It would prime all right;
but, so soon as I gave it steam, the water would break.
Driven to my wits’ end, I made the fireman try to work
the injector, while I went down and watched its action.
Everything seemed tight: I had examined the strainer,
and there appeared no reason why it should not operate
as well as it ever did. While watching it, I saw a drop
of water oozing out at the stem of the overflow-valve;
but I reasoned, “That can not affect the working of the
injector, because it is ahead of where the water starts.”
But, seeing that the thing would persist in not working,
I put a bit of packing in the overflow-stem, thinking it
will do no harm any way; and then the injector went to
work all right, and I had no more trouble with it. So
a defect that may seem trifling, sometimes proves serious
to an injector.</p>

<h3>COMMON DEFECTS.</h3>

<p>As maintaining unbroken speed on the water put in
motion is the first essential in keeping an injector in good
working-order, any thing that has a tendency to reduce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>128</span>
that speed will jeopardize its action. A variety of influences
combine to reduce the original efficiency of an
injector. Those with fixed nozzles are constructed with
the orifices of a certain size, and in the proportion to
each other which experiment has demonstrated to be
best for feeding with the varied steam-pressures. When
these orifices get worn out of the proper size, the injector
will work badly; and nothing will cure it but new
tubes. The tubes sometimes get loose inside the shell
of the injector, and drop down out of line. The water
will then strike against the side of the next tube, or on
some point out of the true line, scattering it into spray,
which contains no energy to force itself into the boiler.
A machinist examining a defective injector, should
always make sure that the tubes are not loose. Injectors
that suffer from this defect will not work without a
high pressure of steam. Injectors suffering from incrusted
water-passages will generally work best with
the steam low. Cases of the latter kind are common in
calcareous districts. I have known instances where
injectors got so incrusted with lime that the passages
were almost closed.</p>

<p>Joints about injectors that are kept tight by packing
must be closely watched. Many an injector that failed
to work satisfactorily has been entirely cured by packing
the ram-gland.</p>

<h3>CARE OF INJECTORS IN WINTER.</h3>

<p>During severe frosty weather, an injector can be kept
in order much easier than a pump; but it needs constant
watching and intelligent supervision.</p>

<p>To keep an injector clear of danger from frost, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>129</span>
should be fitted up so that all the pipes can be thoroughly
drained, by frost-cocks put in for that purpose.
Bends in the pipes, where water could stand, should be
avoided as far as possible; and, where they can not
be avoided, the lowest point should contain a frost-cock.</p>

<p>To run an injector successfully, thoughtful care is
requisite on the part of the engineer; and, where this
is given, the injector will prove itself a very economical
boiler-feeder.</p>

<h3>SELLERS INJECTOR.</h3>

<p>When the Giffard injector was first introduced into
this country, by William Sellers &amp; Co., Philadelphia, it
was a very defective boiler-feeder; but that firm effected
great improvements, and led the way for making the
injector the popular boiler-feeder it is to-day. They
made the instrument self-adjusting, and improved its
design, so that it would automatically feed, however
much the pressure of the boiler varied. After numerous
changes, the injector of 1876 was produced, which is
shown by a sectional view in <a href="#i_2">Fig. 2</a>. The Sellers
injector of to-day remains substantially the same as it
was when exhibited at the Centennial Exposition.</p>

<div id="i_2" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 42em;">
  <img src="images/i_p130.png" width="659" height="393" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span></div></div>

<p>Referring to <a href="#i_2">Fig. 2</a>, <i>A</i> is the receiving-tube, which
will be closed to the admission of steam by the valve <i>X</i>.
A hollow spindle passing through the receiving-tube
into the combining-tube, is secured to the rod <i>B</i>; and
the valve <i>X</i> is fitted to this spindle in such a way, that
the latter can be moved a slight distance (until the stop
shown in the figure engages with valve <i>X</i>) without raising
the valve <i>X</i> from its seat. A second valve, <i>W</i>,
secured to the rod <i>B</i>, has its seat in the upper side of<span class="pagenum hide"><a id="Page_130"></a>130</span>
the valve <i>X</i>, so that it can be opened (thus admitting
steam to the center of the spindle) without raising the
valve <i>X</i> from its seat, if the rod <i>B</i> is not drawn out any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>131</span>
farther, after the stop on the hollow spindle comes in
contact with the valve <i>X</i>. <i>D</i> is the delivery-tube, <i>O</i> an
overflow opening into space <i>C</i>, <i>K</i> the check-valve in
delivery-pipe, and <i>P R</i> the waste-valve. The upper end
of the combining-tube has a piston <i>N N</i> attached to it,
capable of moving freely in a cylindrical portion of the
shell <i>M M</i>; and the lower end of the combining-tube
slides in a cylindrical guide formed in the upper end of
the delivery-tube.</p>

<p>The rod <i>B</i> is connected to a cross-head, which is fitted
over the guide-rod <i>J</i>; and a lever <i>H</i> is secured to the
cross-head. A rod <i>L</i>, attached to a lever on the top
end of the screw waste-valve, passes through an eye
that is secured to the lever <i>H</i>; and stops <i>T</i>, <i>Q</i>, control
the motion of this rod, so that the waste-valve is closed
when the lever <i>H</i> has its extreme outward throw, and
is opened when the lever is thrown in so as to close the
steam-valve <i>X</i>; while the lever can be moved between
the positions of the stops <i>P</i>, <i>Q</i>, without affecting the
waste-valve. A latch <i>V</i> is thrown into action with
teeth cut in the upper side of the guide-rod <i>J</i>, when the
lever <i>H</i> is drawn out to its full extent, and then moved
back; and this click is raised out of action as soon as it
has been moved in far enough to pass the last tooth on
the rod <i>J</i>. An air-vessel is arranged in the body of the
instrument, as shown in the figure, for the purpose of
securing a continuous jet when the injector and its connections
are exposed to shocks, especially such as occur
in the use of the instrument on locomotives.</p>

<p>The manipulation required to start the injector is
exceedingly simple,—much more so in practice, indeed,
than it can be rendered in description. Moving the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>132</span>
lever <i>H</i> until contact takes place between valve <i>X</i> and
stop on hollow spindle, which can be felt by the hand
upon the lever, steam is admitted to the center of the
spindle, and, expanding as it passes into the delivery-tube
<i>D</i> and waste-orifice <i>P</i>, lifts the water through the
supply-pipe into the combining-tube around the hollow
spindle, acting after the manner of an ejector or steam-siphon.
As soon as solid water issues through the
waste-orifice <i>P</i>, the handle <i>H</i> may be drawn out to its
full extent, opening the steam-valve <i>X</i>, and closing the
waste-valve, when the action of the injector will be continuous
as long as steam and water are supplied to it.</p>

<h3>THE NATHAN MANUFACTURING COMPANY’S MONITOR INJECTOR.</h3>

<div id="i_3" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 32em;">
  <img src="images/i_p132.png" width="498" height="315" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span></div></div>

<p>One of the most successful and enduring injectors in
use is the Monitor, the distinguishing feature of which
is, that the injector is constructed with fixed nozzles,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>133</span>
that insure great durability, combined with certainty of
action. The Monitor injector is shown in section in
<a href="#i_3">Fig. 3</a>. To start the injector, the middle cock is opened,
which is the lifting-jet. When water appears at the
overflow, the steam-valve is opened, and the lifting-jet
closed. The work of the injector is regulated by the
lazy-cock, which is the bottom handle. A movable
valve, operated by an eccentric on the stem, is now employed
as a lazy-cock; a common cock having been found
troublesome during frosty weather. The combining-tube
is attached to the line-check, and can be taken out
with the check, which provides an easy means of effecting
examination or repairs.</p>

<h3>THE KORTING INJECTOR.</h3>

<div id="i_4" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 32em;">
  <img src="images/i_p133.png" width="498" height="317" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span></div></div>

<p>An examination of <a href="#i_4">Fig. 4</a> will show that this injector
is a double-tube instrument; the first tube being proportioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>134</span>
for raising and delivering the water under pressure
to the second one, which completes the operation
of forcing the water into the boiler. This arrangement
enables the injector to be worked through a wide
range of steam-pressures without any adjustment of
parts. By making the first tube proportionately small,
a high power of suction is obtained, which enables the
injector to feed water of such high temperature that it
may be delivered into the boiler above the boiling-point.
The Korting injector is operated entirely by one handle,
and requires no instruction to teach its working.
The feed is regulated by the patent combined regulation-valve
and dirt-stop, which regulates the supply of
water, and prevents the possibility of dirt reaching the
injector.</p>

<h3>THE HANCOCK INSPIRATOR.</h3>

<div id="i_5" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 18em;">
  <img src="images/i_p135.png" width="281" height="585" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span></div></div>

<p><a href="#i_5">Fig. 5</a> gives a cross-section of the Hancock inspirator.
It consists essentially of a lifting-jet and lifting-nozzle,
combined with a forcing-jet and force-nozzle or
injector; steam being admitted to both of these nozzles
whenever the inspirator is working, to deliver the supply-water
to the force-nozzle, and to force it through the
nozzle into the boiler. Although both the lifting and
forcing nozzles are fixed, their proportion, one to the
other, is such that the inspirator requires no adjustment
for changes in steam-pressure or water-supply; the
waste-valve being kept closed while the instrument is in
operation, except at the time of starting. The duplex
nozzle arrangement of the Hancock inspirator enables
that instrument to feed water of high temperature. In
this respect it will act as well as the ordinary pump,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>135</span>
besides having all the advantages of an injector. A
form of inspirator is made specially for locomotive service,
which is operated by a single handle.</p>

<h3>CARE OF LOCOMOTIVE BOILERS.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> present tendency of steam engineering, in the
effort to increase the work performed in return for
every pound of fuel consumed, is to employ steam of
very high pressure. The greater the initial pressure of
the steam, the greater are the advantages to be derived
from its expansive principle. To resist successfully the
enormous aggregate of pressure to which locomotive
boilers are subjected, a well-constructed strong boiler
is absolutely necessary; and the various railroad companies
throughout the country meet the required conditions
in an admirable manner, as is evidenced by the
remarkable exemption of such boilers from serious accidents.
Although the locomotive is the most intensely
pressed boiler in common use, that supreme disaster,
an explosion, is of rare occurrence, considering the vast
number of boilers doing service all over the States.
This result is due to constant care in the construction,
in the maintenance, and in the management, of the locomotive
boiler. Like the conservation of liberty, eternal
vigilance is the price of safety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>137</span></p>

<h3>FACTOR OF SAFETY.</h3>

<p>There is perfect safety in using a boiler so long as a
good margin of resisting power is maintained above the
tendency within to tear the sheets asunder. This margin
is very low for locomotive boilers generally, hence
the greater necessity for care in maintenance and management.
Years ago the mechanical world established
by practice a rule making one-fifth of the ultimate
strength of a boiler its safe working-pressure. That is,
a boiler carrying 140 pounds working-pressure should
be capable of withstanding a tension of 700 pounds to
the square inch before rupture ensues. Locomotive
practice in this country does not provide much more
than half of that margin of safety. When deterioration
or accident reduces this margin, danger begins.</p>

<h3>BOILER EXPLOSIONS.</h3>

<p>Certain mechanical empirics and impractical quasi-scientists
have at various times attempted to surround
the cause of boiler explosions with a halo of mystery.
But our most accomplished scientists who have made
the subject a special study, and our best mechanical
experts who have devoted years of patient experiment
and research to the investigation of boiler explosion,
attribute the terrible phenomenon to intelligible causes
alone. The conclusions of the practical part of the
mechanical world are well summed in one sentence in
one of the annual reports of the Master Mechanics’
Association. It says, “Explosions originate from
over-pressure: it matters not whether the whole
boiler, or a portion of it, is too weak to resist the
pressure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>138</span></p>

<h3>PRESERVATION OF BOILERS.</h3>

<p>The preservation of a boiler depends very much upon
the care and attention bestowed upon it by the engineer,
and no other person is so much interested in its
safety. To prevent undue strains from being put upon
the boiler, the engineer should see that the safety-valves
and the steam-gauge are kept in proper order.
To secure this, the steam-gauge should be tested at
least once a month. The rule established on well-conducted
roads, prohibiting engineers from interfering
with safety-valves, is a very judicious one; and no persons
are more interested in its strict observance than
the engineers themselves.</p>

<h3>CAUSING INJURY TO BOILERS.</h3>

<p>Some men are idiotic enough to habitually screw
down safety-valves, that the engine may be able to overcome
heavy grades without doubling. This is criminal
recklessness, and all train men are interested in its suppression.
Low water has often been blamed falsely as
the cause of disaster to boilers; a theory having prevailed,
that permitting the water to become low led to
the generation of an explosive gas which no sheet could
withstand. That theory was exploded long ago; but,
nevertheless, it is certain that low water paves the way
for explosions by deteriorating the fire-box sheets, and
destroying stay-bolts. A careful engineer watches to
prevent his engine from getting “scorched” even
slightly; for the smallest scorching may yield a harvest
of trouble, even after many days. The danger of scorching
is most imminent when an engine is foaming badly
from the effects of impurities in the feed-water or in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>139</span>
the boiler. At such a time the water rises so lavishly
with the steam, that the gauges are no indication of the
true water-level. The steam must be shut off to find
the true level of the water. Where this trouble is experienced,
the engineer should err on the safe side, even
though untold patience is needed to work the engine
along with the boiler full of water.</p>

<h3>DANGERS OF MUD AND SCALE.</h3>

<p>Mud within the boiler, and scales adhering to the
heating surface, are dangerous enemies to the preservation
of boilers; and engineers should strive to prevent
their evil effects by rooting them out so far as practicable.
Much can be banished by washing out frequently;
and scales can, to some extent, be prevented by selecting
the softest water on the road. If water in a tank is
so hard that it makes soap curdle instead of lather when
a man attempts to wash with it, that tank should be
avoided as far as possible.</p>

<h3>BLOWING OFF BOILERS.</h3>

<p>The sudden cooling down of boilers, by blowing them
off while hot, is a most pernicious practice, which is responsible
for many cracked sheets and broken stay-bolts.
It also tends to make a boiler scale the heating
surfaces rapidly. Every time a boiler is blown out hot,
if the water contains calcareous solution, a coat of mud
is left on the heating surfaces, which dries hard while
the steel is hot. If a piece of scale taken from a boiler
periodically subjected to this blowing-out process be
closely examined, it will be found to consist of thin
layers, every one representing a period of blowing off,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>140</span>
just as plainly as the laminæ of our rocks indicate the
method of their formation. When a boiler must be
cooled down quickly for washing out or other purposes,
the steam should be blown off, and the boiler gradually
filled up with water. Then open the blow-off cock, and
keep water running in about as fast as it runs out until
the temperature gets even with the atmosphere. The
boiler may now be emptied without injury. Or another
good plan is to blow off about two gauges of water
under a pressure of forty or fifty pounds of steam, then
cool down the boiler gradually, to prepare for washing.</p>

<p>Although the dangers of blowing off hot boilers, and
then rushing in cold water to wash out, are well known
and acknowledged, yet the practice is still followed on
many roads where more intelligent action might be
expected.</p>

<h3>OVER-PRESSURE.</h3>

<p>Should it happen from any cause that the safety-valves
fail to relieve the boiler, and the steam runs up beyond
a safe tension, the situation is critical; but the engineer
should not resort to any method of giving sudden relief.
To jerk the safety-valve wide open at such a time is a
most dangerous proceeding. A disastrous explosion
lately occurred to a locomotive boiler from this cause.
The safety-valves had been working badly; and, while
the engine was standing on a side track, they allowed
the steam to rise considerably above the working-pressure.
When the engineer perceived this, he threw open
the safety-valve by means of a relief lever, and the
boiler instantly went into fragments. Cases have occurred
where the quick opening of a throttle-valve has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>141</span>
produced a similar result. The proximate cause of such
an accident was the violent motion of water and steam
within the boiler, induced by the sudden diminution
of pressure at one point; but the real cause of the disaster
was a weak boiler,—a boiler with insufficient
margin of resisting power. The weakest part of a boiler
is its strongest point. This may seem paradoxical, but
a moment’s reflection will show that the highest
strength of a boiler merely reaches to the point where
it will give out. Hence engineers should see that a
boiler is properly examined for unseen defects so soon
as signs of distress appear. Leaky throat-sheets or
seams, stay-heads dripping, or incipient cracks, are indications
of weakness; and their call should be attended
to without delay.</p>

<h3>RELIEVING OVER-PRESSURE.</h3>

<p>When an engineer finds the steam rising beyond a
safe pressure, he should reduce it by opening the heaters,
starting the injector, dampening the fire, or even
by blowing the whistle. The whistle offers a convenient
means of getting rid of superfluous steam, and its
noise can be stopped by tying a rag between the bell
and the valve opening.</p>

<h3>BURSTED FLUES.</h3>

<p>Should any boiler attachment, such as a check-valve
or blow-off cock, blow out or break off, no time should
be lost in quenching the fire. That is the first consideration.
A bursted flue will generally save an engineer
the labor of extinguishing the fire. In this case an engineer’s
efforts should be directed to reducing the pressure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>142</span>
of steam as quickly as possible, so that he may be
able to plug the flue before the water gets out of the
boiler. Flue-plugs and a rod for holding them are very
requisite articles; but, in driving flue-plugs, care must
be exercised not to hammer too hard, or a broken flue-sheet
may result. Plugs are often at hand without a
rod to hold them. In such an emergency, a hard
wooden rail can be used; the plug being fastened to the
end by means of nails and wire, or even wet cord.
Where no iron plug is available, a wooden plug driven
well in, away from the reach of the fire, may prevent a
bursted flue from leaking, and enable the engine to go
along; but wooden plugs are very unreliable for such
a purpose. They may hold if the rupture in the flue
should be some distance inside; but, should the cause
of leaking be close to the flue-sheet, a wooden plug will
burn out in a few minutes.</p>

<h3>RUNNING WORN-OUT ENGINES.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Some</span> of our most successful engineers, the men who
pull our most important trains daily on time, attribute
their good fortune in avoiding delays, to training they
received in youth, while running or firing worn-out
engines that could only be kept going by constant
attention and labor. In such cases men must resort
to innumerable makeshifts to get over the road; they
have frequently to dissect the machinery to remedy
defects; they learn in the impressive school of experience
how a broken-down engine can best be taken
home, and how breaking down can best be prevented.
Firemen and young engineers, generally feel aggrieved
at being assigned to run on worn-out engines,—the
scrap heaps as they are called: but the man who has
not passed through this ordeal has missed a Golconda
of experience; his potentialities are petrified without
reaching action.</p>

<h3>CARE AND ENERGY DEFY DEFEAT.</h3>

<p>Among a certain class of seafaring men, the captain
of a ship who fails from any cause to bring his vessel
safely into port, is regarded as disgraced; and, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>144</span>
a true sailor will use superhuman efforts to prevent
his ship from becoming derelict, often preferring
to follow it to the bottom rather than abandon his trust.
In many instances the sentiments and traditions of
seamen teach railroad men valuable lessons. The sacrifice
of life is not desired or expected of engineers
in their care of the vessel they command; but every
engineer worthy of the name will spare no personal
exertion, will shrink from no hardship, that will be
necessary to prevent his charge from becoming derelict.
Once I heard a hoary engineer, who had become
gray on the footboard, make the proud boast, “My
engine never was towed in.” His calm words conveyed
an eloquent sermon on care and perseverance.
He had been in many hard straits, he had been in
collisions, he had been ditched with engines, but had
always managed to get them home without assistance.</p>

<h3>WATCHING THE EXHAUST.</h3>

<p>What the beating pulse is as an aid to the physician
in diagnosing diseases, the sound of the exhaust is to
the engineer as a means of enabling him to distinguish
between perfective and defective working of the locomotive.
The ability to detect a slight derangement
by the sound of the exhaust, can only be acquired by
practice in watching those steam-notes day after day,
as they play their tune of labor through the smoke-stack.
When the steam-ports are even, and the valves
correctly set, with tight piston-packing, and valves free
from leaks, the notes of the exhaust will sound forth in
regular succession in sharp, ringing, clear tones, every
puff seeming to cut the steam clean off at the top of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>145</span>
the stack. There is a long array of defects represented
in the journey from this case of apparently
perfect steam performance, to that where the exhaust
steam escapes as an unbroken roar mixed with uncertain,
wheezy coughs.</p>

<h3>THE ATTENTIVE EAR DETECTS DETERIORATION OF VALVES.</h3>

<p>The deterioration of piston-packing, and the rounding
of valve-seats, which produce an asthmatic exhaust,
may be followed in their downward course if the
engineer gets into the habit of listening to the exhaust,
and marking its changes. It is very important that he
should do so. The man whose ear from long practice
has become sensitive to a false tone of the exhaust,
needs not to make experiments, by applying steam to
the engine while it stands in various positions, in order
to find out where a blow comes from,—whether it is
in the pistons or in the valves.</p>

<h3>LOCATING THE FOUR EXHAUST SOUNDS.</h3>

<p>Leaning out of the cab-window, he watches the
crank as it revolves, and compares the noise made by
the blowing steam with the crank position. When
pulling on a heavy grade is an excellent time for noting
imperfections in the working of valves and pistons;
for the movements are comparatively slow, while the
pressure of steam on the working-parts is so heavy
that any leak sounds prominently forth. The observing
engineer perceives that the four sounds of the exhaust,
due to each revolution of the drivers, occur a few inches
before the crank reaches, first, the forward center,
second, the bottom quarter, third, the back center,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>146</span>
fourth, the top quarter. The first and third position
exhausts emit the steam from the forward and back
strokes of the right-hand piston: the second and fourth
exhausts are due to discharges of the steam that has
been propelling the left-hand piston. With these facts
impressed upon his mind, he will understand, that if
an intermittent blow occurs during the periods when
the crank is traveling from the forward center to the
bottom quarter, or from the back center to the top
quarter, the chances will be that the right-hand piston
needs to be examined. For the greatest pressure of
steam follows the piston just after the beginning of
each stroke, and that is the time a blow will assert
itself. Should the blow occur while the right-hand
crank is moving from the bottom quarter to the back
center, or from the top quarter to the forward center,
it will indicate that the left-hand piston is at fault.
For at these periods the left-hand cylinder is receiving
its greatest pressure of steam.</p>

<h3>IDENTIFYING DEFECTS BY SOUND OF THE STEAM.</h3>

<p>It is generally understood that an intermittent or
recurring blow belongs to the pistons, and that a constant
blow comes from the valves. But sometimes the
valves blow intermittently, being tight at certain points
of the travel, and leaky at other points. To distinguish
between the character of these blows is sometimes a
little difficult except to the thoroughly practiced ear.
The sound of the blow can be heard best when the
door is open, and the novice should not fail to listen
for it under that condition. The valve blow is a sort
of wheeze, with the suggestion of a whistle in it: the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>147</span>
piston makes a clean, honest blow, which would break
into a distinct roar if enough steam could get through.
But a whistling sound in the exhaust is, by no means,
a certain indication of the valves blowing through; for
sometimes the nozzles get clogged up with a gummy
substance from the lubricating oils, and a distinct
whistling exhaust results therefrom. With a watchful
ear, the progress of degeneration in the valves can be
noted day after day; for it is a decay which goes on by
degrees,—the inevitable slow destruction that friction
inflicts upon rubbing surfaces. Pistons are more erratic
in their calls for attention. With them it is quite
common for a stalwart blow to start out without any
warning, the cause generally being broken packing-rings.
The various kinds of steam packing seem more
liable to have broken rings than the old-fashioned
spring packing, but they generally run longer with less
attention.</p>

<h3>ACCIDENTS PREVENTED BY ATTENDING TO THE NOTE OF WARNING
FROM THE EXHAUST.</h3>

<p>The habit of closely watching the exhaust is likely
to prove serviceable in more ways than in keeping the
engineer posted on the condition of the steam-distribution
gear. Its sound often acts as a danger alarm,
which should never go unheeded. Many an engine
has gone home on one side, and not a few have been
towed in cold, through accidents to the valve-gear,
which could have been prevented had the engineer
attended to the warning voice of a false exhaust. The
nuts work off an eccentric-strap bolt; and it drops out,
letting the strap open far enough to cause an uneven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>148</span>
valve-travel. If the engineer hears this, and stops
immediately to examine the machinery, he is likely to
detect the defect before the strap breaks. Again, one
side of a valve yoke may have snapped, leaving the
other side to bear the load; or bolts belonging to different
parts of the links or eccentric-straps may be
working out,—so that the uniformity of the valve-travel
is affected; and the same result may be produced
by the eccentrics getting loose. Young engineers, to
whom these pages are addressed, should make up their
minds that an engine never exhausts an irregular note
without something being the matter which does not
admit of running to a station before being examined.
It may only be an eccentric slipped a little way, a mishap
that is not calculated to result disastrously; but,
on the other hand, it is probably something of a more
dangerous character.</p>

<h3>NEGLECTING A WARNING.</h3>

<p>Engineer Joy of the D. &amp; E. road went in with a
broken eccentric-strap. Questioning him about the
accident brought out the fact, that, in starting from a
station, he heard the engine make two or three curious
exhausts; but he was running on a time-order, and did
not wish to cause delay by stopping to examine the
engine. But he had not gone half a mile when he
found it necessary to stop and disconnect the engine,
and by doing so held an express train forty minutes.</p>

<h3>HOW AN ECCENTRIC-STRAP PUNCHED A HOLE IN A FIRE-BOX.</h3>

<p>A representative case of neglecting a plain warning
happened on an Illinois road some time ago. John<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>149</span>
Thomas was pulling a freight train up a grade, when,
to use his own words, “The engine began to exhaust
in the funniest way you ever heard. She would get
on to three legs for an engine length or so, then she
would work as square and true as she ever did, but only
for a few turns, when she got to limping again.” This
runner knew that something was wrong, and he determined
to examine the engine at the next stopping-point.
But delays in such a case are full of peril.
When he got over the grade, and shut off steam, there
was a tumultuous rattling of the reverse-lever, succeeded
by a fearful pounding about the machinery; a
tearing up of road-bed sent a shower of sand and
gravel over the train; then a scream from escaping
steam and water drowned all other noises, and the
engine was enveloped in a cloud of blinding vapor.
The forward bolt of one of the eccentric-strap rods
had worked out, and allowed the end of the rod to drop
on the track. Then it doubled up, and tore away
the whole side of the motion; and part of a broken
eccentric-strap knocked a hole in the fire-box. Here
was the progress towards destruction. A small pin
got lost, which permitted the nut of an important bolt
to unscrew itself; then this bolt, with many a warning
jar and jerk, escaped from its place in the link; and the
conditions for a first-class break-down had come round.</p>

<h3>INTEREST IN THE VALVE-MOTION AMONG ENGINEERS.</h3>

<p>Whenever locomotive engineers congregate in the
round-house, in the lodge or division room, a fruitful
theme of conversation and discussion is the valve-motion.
Curious opinions are often heard expressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>150</span>
upon this complex subject. There are comparatively
few men who understand it properly: but it has a
fascination which attracts all alike, the wise and the
ignorant; and the man who is altogether uncertain
about the true meaning of lap and lead, expansion and
compression, is generally more loquacious on valve-motion
than the engineer who has made the subject
an industrious study.</p>

<h3>TROUBLE WITH THE VALVE-MOTION.</h3>

<p>However well each may understand his business, in
one respect all engineers are in perfect harmony; that
is, in hating to encounter trouble with the valve-gear
on the road. The valves being the lungs of the
machine, any injury or defect to their connections
strikes at a vital organ. With a good valve-motion,
and valves properly set, the steam is distributed so that
nearly an equal amount is admitted through each part
in regular rotation; the release taking place in even
succession. This makes the exhaust notes uniform in
pitch and period. A sudden departure from this uniformity
indicates that something is wrong with the
valve-motion. It should be the signal to stop, and
institute a searching examination. In doing so, avoid
jumping at conclusions regarding the cause of the
irregularity, and coolly examine, separately, each part
whose motion influences the valve-travel.</p>

<h3>A WRONG CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p>Fred Bemis missed his luck by jumping too readily
at conclusions. Something happened to his engine;
and he stopped by compulsion, and found it would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>151</span>
not move either way. He felt certain that both eccentrics
on one side had slipped; and, considering himself
equal to setting any number of eccentrics, he got
down, and fixed them in what he supposed was the
proper position. But, on trying to move the engine, he
found it still refused to go. He kept working at
those eccentrics without result till his water got low,
and he was compelled to dump the fire; the consequence
being, that the engine went cold, and was towed
home. When an examination was made, it was found
that a broken valve-yoke was the cause of trouble.</p>

<h3>LOCATING DEFECTS OF THE VALVE-MOTION.</h3>

<p>When any thing goes wrong with the valve-motion,
the first point of investigation is, to find out which side
is at fault. This can be ascertained by opening the
cylinder-cocks, and giving the engine steam. With
the reverse-lever in forward motion, the forward cylinder-cocks
should show steam when the crank-pins are
traveling below the axle, and the back cocks should
blow when the pins make their similar revolution above
the axle. Any departure from this method of steam
distribution will make one side work against the other.
When the engineer has satisfied himself on which side
the defect lies, he will do well to thoroughly examine the
eccentrics with their straps and rods, the links with
their hangers and saddles, the rocker box and arms
with all the bolts and pins connecting these articles.
What might be regarded as a trifling defect, sometimes
makes an engine lame. I have known a loose valve-stem
key put an engine badly out of square. Eccentric-rods,
slipping, often produce this effect. When<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>152</span>
the eccentrics are found in the proper position, the
rocker-box secure in the shaft, and all the bolts, pins,
and keys in good order, and in their proper positions,
the fault may be looked for in the steam-chest.</p>

<h3>POSITION OF ECCENTRICS.</h3>

<p>With engines where keys are not used to secure the
eccentrics to the shaft, their slipping on the road is a
common occurrence. Eccentric-strap oil-passages getting
stopped up, or neglect in not oiling these straps or
the valves, puts an unnecessary tension on the eccentrics,
which often results in their slipping on the shaft.
Engineers ought to mark the proper position for eccentrics
on the shaft; so that, when slipping happens, it
can be adjusted without the delay that often occurs in
calculating the right position. When the crank-pin is
on the forward center, the body of the go-ahead eccentric
is above the axle, and the body of the back-up
eccentric is below the axle, each of the eccentrics
being advanced about 1/16 of the revolution from the
right angle position towards the crank-pin; or, to state
it more accurately, the center of the eccentric is advanced
a horizontal distance to equal the lap and lead
of the valve. If the valve had neither lap nor lead, the
eccentrics would stand exactly at right angles to the
crank. As it is, both of them have a tendency to hug
the crank; the eccentric which regulates the distribution
of steam following the crank. Every engineer
should familiarize himself with the correct position of
eccentrics, so that, when trouble happens with the valve-gear
on the road, he will experience no difficulty in
grappling with the mishap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>153</span></p>

<h3>METHOD OF SETTING SLIPPED ECCENTRICS.</h3>

<p>The slipping of one eccentric is a trifling matter,
which can be quickly remedied if the set screws are
in a position where they can be reached conveniently.
If it is a go-ahead eccentric, set the engine on the
center of the disabled side,—no matter which center,—put
the reverse-lever in the back notch of the quadrant,
and scratch a line with a knife on the valve-stem
close to the gland. Then put the lever in the forward
notch, and move the slipped eccentric till the line
appears in the point where it was made. Fasten the
set screws, and the engine will be found true enough
to proceed with the train. Care must be taken in
moving the eccentric to see that the full part is not
placed in the same position as the other one, or they
will both be set for back motion. A back-up eccentric
slipped, while the go-ahead one remains intact, can be
adjusted in a similar way; the scratch on the valve-stem
being made with the engine in full forward motion, and
the adjustment of the eccentric done in full back
motion. The philosophy of this method is, that the
valve is in nearly the same position at the beginning
of the stroke for the forward or back motion; and the
position of the eccentric, which has not moved, is used
to find the proper place for the one which slipped.
Should the unusual circumstance of both eccentrics on
one side slipping overtake an engineer, he will have to
pursue a different method of adjustment. The most
systematic plan is to place the engine on the forward
center, and set the go-ahead eccentric above the axle,
and the back-up eccentric below the axle. With the
reverse-lever in the forward notch, advance the top<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>154</span>
eccentric till the front cylinder-cock shows steam, which
can be ascertained by blocking the wheels, and slightly
opening the throttle. That will put the go-ahead eccentric
near enough to the proper position for running.
For the back-up eccentric, pull the reverse-lever into
back motion, and turn the eccentric towards the crank-pin
till steam appears at the front cylinder-cock;
and that part of the motion will be right. Or the
back-up eccentric can be set by the forward eccentric
in the manner described where one eccentric has
slipped.</p>

<h3>SLIPPED ECCENTRIC-RODS.</h3>

<p>Where slotted rods are used, they frequently slip,
making the engine lame. The cause of trouble in
such a case can be identified by moving the engine
slowly, with the cylinder-cocks open. The disturbance
to the regularity of the valve’s motion, caused by a
slipped rod, will admit steam prematurely on one end
of the cylinder, while it delays the admission on the
other end. The valve is made to travel more on one
side of the exhaust center than on the other. Lengthening
or shortening the valve-stem has a similar effect,
but this makes the engine lame in both gears; while
the slipping of an eccentric-rod only makes the engine
lame in the motion that the rod belongs to. This is
subject to a slight modification, however; for the back-motion
eccentric being badly out of square, will affect
the correctness of the forward motion, when the engine
is working close hooked up. But in full motion it will
not be perceptible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>155</span></p>

<h3>DETECTING THE CAUSE OF A LAME EXHAUST.</h3>

<p>If in moving the engine ahead slowly, with the cylinder-cocks
open, it is found that steam is admitted to
the cylinder before the piston has nearly reached the
center or dead point, or that the back cylinder-cock
does not show steam till after the piston has passed the
back center, the eccentric-rod is too long. The rod
being too short produces precisely an opposite effect.
The steam arrives late on the back stroke, and ahead
of time on the forward stroke. This is different from
the action of the steam where an eccentric has slipped.
In that case, there will be pre-admission of steam
before the beginning of both strokes, or post-admission,
that is, late arrival of steam, for both strokes.
Take a go-ahead eccentric for example. If it slips
backward on the shaft, its effect will be to delay the
admission of steam till after the beginning of each
stroke; and, if it slips forward, the result will be to
accelerate the lead of the valve opening the steam-port
before the piston has reached the commencement of
each stroke.</p>

<h3>WHAT TO DO WHEN ECCENTRICS, STRAPS, OR RODS BREAK.</h3>

<p>When either of these accidents happens, the safest
plan is to take down both straps and rods on the defective
side. Some engineers leave the back-up eccentric
strap and rod on, when the forward strap or rod has
broken; but it is a little risky under certain conditions.
After getting the eccentric straps and rods down, drop
the link-hanger away from the tumbling-shaft, disconnect
the valve-stem, and tie the valve-rod to the hand-rail.
Then set the valve in the middle of the seat, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>156</span>
that it will cover both the steam-ports, and hold it in
that position by pinching the stem with the gland,
which is done by screwing up the gland obliquely.
Take down the main rod, and block the cross-head
securely at the back end of the guides. Good hardwood
blocking prepared beforehand should be used for
this purpose, and it ought to be fastened with a rope or
marline. A neater plan for holding the cross-head in
place is described by Frank C. Smith, in the <i>Torch</i>.
He says, “Have the blacksmith make a hook out of a
piece of inch and a half round iron; also a piece about
fifteen inches long by one and a half thick, and four
inches wide, with a hole through the center for the
shank of the hook to pass through. This shank is
threaded for a nut. Now, when it is necessary to block
a piston, get it to the back end, pass the hook around
the wrist of the cross-head, and the other end through
the straight piece which bears against the yoke supporting
the back end of the guides; run up a nut
on the shank of the hook, hard against the cross-piece,
and the piston is secured.” The piston being
properly fastened, it is a wise supplement to the work
to tie the cylinder-cocks open, or to take them out
altogether. The engine is now ready to proceed on
one side.</p>

<p>Young engineers can not be too strongly impressed
with the necessity for having the cross-head properly
secured before trying to move the engine. I have
repeatedly known of serious damage being caused by
placing too much confidence in weak blocking. Taking
out the cylinder-cocks is a wise security against accidents
of this kind; for, should a little steam be passing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>157</span>
through the valve, it has a port of escape without putting
heavy pressure on the piston.</p>

<h3>DIFFERENT WAYS OF SECURING THE CROSS-HEAD.</h3>

<p>In regard to the method of securing the piston when
one side of an engine is taken down, there is considerable
diversity of opinion among engineers. Some men
maintain that the proper and quick plan is, merely to
move the piston to one end of the cylinder, pushing the
valve in the same direction, so that the steam-port will
be open at the end away from the piston. This will
keep the cylinder full of steam, and hold the piston
from moving. But, if by any accident the valve should
be moved to the opposite end of the seat, steam would
get to the wrong end of the cylinder, and the piston
would certainly smash out the head. Another risky plan,
practiced by men economical of work, is to place the
valve on the center of the seat, and let the piston go
without fastening. These slipshod methods do not pay.</p>

<h3>BROKEN TUMBLING-SHAFT.</h3>

<p>This accident is very serious; but it need not disable
the engine, although it will lessen the engineer’s power
to manage it freely. To get the engine going, calculate
the position the links must stand in to pull the
train, and cut pieces of wood to fit between the block
and the top and bottom of the links, so that the latter
may be kept in the required position. For forward
motion, there will be short pieces in the top, and long
pieces in the bottom. When back motion is needed,
reverse the pieces of wood. A common plan is to use
one piece of wood, working the engine in full gear.</p>

<p>The same treatment will keep an engine going when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>158</span>
the tumbling-shaft arms, the reach-rod, the link-hanger,
or the saddle-pin breaks. The failure of a link-hanger
or saddle-pin will only necessitate the blocking of one
side.</p>

<h3>BROKEN VALVE-STEM, OR VALVE-YOKE.</h3>

<p>For a valve-stem broken, the eccentric-strap or link
need not be interfered with. If the break is outside
the steam-chest, take down the valve-stem rod, and set
the valve on the middle of the seat; take down the
main rod, and secure the piston as previously directed.
With a valve-stem broken inside the chest, or a valve-yoke
broken, a little additional work is necessary. The
steam-chest cover must now come up, and the valve be
secured in its proper place by pieces of wood, or any
other material that will keep it from moving; and the
stuffing-box must be closed, to prevent escape of steam
through the space vacated by the valve-stem.</p>

<h3>WHEN A ROCKER-SHAFT OR LOWER ROCKER-ARM BREAKS.</h3>

<p>A broken rocker-shaft, or the fracture of the lower
arm, entails the taking down of both eccentrics and
the link, besides the main rod, and the securing of the
valves and piston. The breaking of an upper rocker-arm
is equivalent to a broken valve-stem, and requires
the same treatment.</p>

<h3>MISCELLANEOUS ACCIDENTS TO VALVE-MOTION.</h3>

<p>Accidents to the valve-seat, such as the breaking of
a bridge, can be fixed for running the engine home on
one side, by covering the ports, and stripping that side<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>159</span>
of the engine, just as had to be done for a broken
valve-yoke. If a serious break in a bridge occurs, it
is indicated by a tremendous blow through the exhaust
port, out by the stack. A mishap of much less consequence
than a broken bridge is a “cocked” valve, and
the small mishap is very liable to be mistaken for the
greater one. Where the yoke is tight fitted, or out of
true with the line of the stem, some engines have a
trick of raising the valve away from the seat, and holding
it there. This generally happens going into a
station; and, when steam is applied in starting out, an
empty roar sounds through the stack. Moving the
valve with the reverse-lever by quick jerks will generally
reseat a cocked valve, but sometimes it gets stuck
so fast that it has to be hammered out of the yoke.</p>

<p>When a locomotive shows the symptoms which indicate
a broken valve, a broken bridge, or a cocked valve,
the engineer should exhaust every means of testing the
matter from the outside before he begins an interior
inspection by raising the steam-chest cover. If jerking
the valve with the reverse-lever, or moving the
engine a little, will not stop the blow, he should disconnect
the valve-stem, and shake the valve by that means.</p>

<p>When a valve breaks, disabling its side of the engine
so badly that it can not be used, the valve should be
taken out, and a piece of strong pine-plank secured
over the ports.</p>

<h3>BROKEN STEAM-CHEST COVER.</h3>

<p>A very serious and troublesome accident, which may
come under the head of steam-distribution gear, is the
breaking of a steam-chest, or of a steam-chest cover.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>160</span>
It takes skillful management to get an engine along
when this has happened. The most effectual way to
restrain loss of steam when a chest or cover has broken,
is to slack up the steam-pipe, and slip a piece of iron
plate, lined with sheet-rubber, leather, canvas, or any
other substance that will help to make a steam-tight
joint, into the lower joint of the steam-pipe. If this
is properly done, it ends the trouble, when the joints
are tightened up. But the difficulties in the way of
loosening steam-pipe joints in a hot smoke-box are
often insurmountable, especially when the nuts and
bolts are solid from corrosion, which is generally the
case where they have not been touched for months. In
such a case it is better to resort to the more clumsy
contrivance of fitting pieces of wood into the openings
to the steam-passage, and bracing them in place by
means of the steam-chest bolts. A man of any ingenuity
can generally, by this means, save himself the
humiliation of being towed home, and yet avoid spending
much time over the operation. When the engineer
has succeeded in securing means for preventing the
escape of steam, the main rod must be taken down,
and the valve-stem rod disconnected from the rocker-arm.
In this instance the piston needs no further
attention, after the main rod has been disconnected;
for there will be no ingress of steam to the cylinder to
endanger its safety.</p>

<h3>STEAM-PIPE BURSTED.</h3>

<p>The breaking of a steam-pipe in the smoke-box is
even a more harassing mishap than a bursted steam-chest
or cover. The only remedy for this is the fastening<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>161</span>
of an iron plate to the top joint of the steam-pipe,
thereby closing up the opening. A heavy plug of hard
wood may be driven into the opening, and braced there
for a short run; but such a stopper is hard to keep in
place, owing to the shrinkage caused by the intense
heat of the smoke-box.</p>

<h3>TESTING THE VALVES.</h3>

<p>An experienced engineer will most easily determine
the existence of leaks between the valves and their
seats when the engine is working, and the indications
of that weakness have already been noticed. But it
sometimes happens that a man wishes to test the condition
of the valves when the engine is at rest. This
can be most readily accomplished by placing the engine
so that the rocker-arm stands in the vertical position.
Open the smoke-box door so that the exhaust nozzles
can be seen. Now block the wheels, and give the
engine steam. If the valve blows, the steam will be
seen issuing from the nozzle on the side under examination.
As the tendency of a slide-valve is to wear the
seat concave, it sometimes happens that a valve is tight
on the center, yet leaky in other positions. Moving
the valve with the reverse-lever as far as can be done
without opening the steam-port, will sometimes demonstrate
this. The cranks should be placed on the eighths
positions when the valves are being tested.</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>ACCIDENTS TO CYLINDERS AND STEAM CONNECTIONS.</i></span>
</h2>
</div>

<h3>IMPORTANCE OF THE PISTON IN THE TRAIN OF MECHANISM.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> piston is an autocratic member of the machine.
For thousands of miles it toils to push the engine ahead,
every thing going smoothly so long as it is confined to
its recurring journey; but let any attachment break, or
a key fly out that will increase the piston’s travel, and
away the piston goes, right through a cylinder-head.</p>

<h3>CAUSES THAT LEAD TO BROKEN CYLINDER-HEADS.</h3>

<p>The causes which most commonly lead the piston to
smash out cylinder-heads, are broken cross-heads, broken
piston-rods, and broken main-rods. A main crank-pin
or wrist-pin breaking, is almost certain to leave one
end of the cylinder a wreck. These may be termed the
major causes for breaking out cylinder-heads; but there
are numerous minor causes, which are scarcely less destructive.
A piston-rod key begins to work loose. It
is hammered down occasionally, which does not improve
its fit; and some day it jumps out altogether, letting the
piston go on a voyage of discovery. A machinist of
the careless sort has been examining a piston’s packing,
and, in screwing up the follower-bolts, one of them gets<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>163</span>
a twist too much. Drilling out a follower-bolt is a
troublesome operation, so Mr. Careless lets it go. On
the road this head drops out, and a broken cylinder-head
is the consequence. One of the worst causes of breakage
to a cylinder that I have ever seen, was caused by
the packing-ring of the piston catching in the steam-passage.
Part of the ring broke off, and wedged itself
between the advancing piston and the cylinder. The
wedge split the cylinder open, and the remainder of the
piston acted like a pulverizer upon the fragment of
the cylinder.</p>

<h3>BROKEN CYLINDER-HEADS OFTEN PREVENTABLE.</h3>

<p>The causes which eventually lead to broken cylinder-heads
often originate from preventable strains. Thus,
cross-heads are frequently fractured by main-rod connections
pounding; and weaknesses, that ultimately
bring crank-pins to disaster, originate in a similar way.
A loose piston-key is liable to crack the piston-rod, if it
does not give trouble by jumping out. Loose guides
have a tendency to spring piston-rods, and throw unnecessary
strain upon them. Pistons lined out of true,
are dangerous for the same reason. A pump-plunger
working out of line, or badly secured in the lug, throws
a distressing load upon the cross-head. And so the list
of potential accidents grows. Like the steady water-drop
that wears into the adamantine rock, trifling defects,
assisted by time’s action, prove stronger than the
most massive machine.</p>

<p>When any thing happens to permit the piston to
break out a cylinder-head, the engine can be put in running
trim by taking off the valve-rod and main-rod, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>164</span>
setting the valve on the center of the valve-seat. Blocking
the cross-head is unnecessary, if the break will allow
the escaping steam to pass through; for then no further
tension can be put upon the piston to cause further
damage. If, by an extraordinary freak of good luck, a
piston-rod breaks without causing other damage, the
cylinder-head must be taken off, and the piston removed.
Then cover the ports, and take down the main-rod on
that side. Or, if the cross-head is all right, the main-rod
may be left untouched. When the cross-head
breaks, it generally entails taking out the piston, centering
the valve, and taking down the main-rod on that
side.</p>

<h3>WHEN A MAIN-ROD BREAKS.</h3>

<p>With a broken main-rod which does not knock out
the cylinder-head, the main-rod and valve-rod should be
taken down, the valve secured on the center of the seat,
and the cross-head blocked with the piston at the back
end of the cylinder.</p>

<h3>CRANK-PIN BROKEN.</h3>

<p>For a broken main crank-pin, the above method of
stripping the engine will do with the addition of taking
down both side-rods. An accident which disables one
side-rod, requires that the other one shall be taken down
also, or there will be trouble when the engine is attempted
to be run with one side-rod. The rod might
go all right so long as no slipping happened. But, if the
engine began to slip while passing over the center, the
side-rod would have no leverage on the back crank to
slip its wheel; and a broken rod or crank-pin would
almost certainly ensue.</p>

<p>A broken side-rod, that is not accompanied by other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>165</span>
damage, requires both side-rods to be taken down. All
the inconvenience arising from this is, that the engine
is more liable to slip. But, with dry rails, an engine
can get along very well without its side-rods.</p>

<h3>THROTTLE DISCONNECTED.</h3>

<p>Any accident to the throttle-valve or its attachments,
which deprives the engineer of power to shut off steam,
is very dangerous, and calls for prompt action. Lose
no time in reducing the head of steam to fifty or sixty
pounds, or to the pressure where the engine can easily
be managed with the reverse-lever.</p>

<p>With the aid of a power-brake, an engineer can get
along fairly with a light train, after an accident has
happened which prevents the closing of the steam from
the cylinders; but constant vigilance and thoughtful
labor are needed.</p>

<h3>OILING THE VALVES WHEN THE THROTTLE IS DISCONNECTED.</h3>

<p>The greatest difficulty will be experienced in oiling
the valves, unless the steam-chests are provided with
the automatic feeders, which work with steam on.</p>

<p>If he is running on an undulatory road, an engineer
can oil the valves from the cab, by letting the steam
down at the top of a hill, and running down at a high
speed. It can also generally be done on a level track,
by letting the fire burn low, getting up the best speed
the engine will attain, then putting the feed full on.
As the steam drops suddenly, put the reverse-lever in
full motion; and the chances are, that the valves can
be oiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>166</span></p>

<h3>WHAT CAUSES A DISCONNECTED THROTTLE.</h3>

<p>The most common causes of trouble with the throttle
are the breaking or working out of one of the bolts that
operate the valve within the dome, the breaking of a
valve-rod, or working off of nuts that should secure the
connection. Where the throttle fails with the valve
closed, and the engineer finds it necessary to take the
dome-cover off to prevent his engine from being hauled
in, he will generally find the trouble to lie with the connections
mentioned, or with the bolts belonging to the
bell-crank, that is located near the bottom of the stand-pipe.
Sometimes the nuts on the top of the throttle-valve
stem work off: but, in such a case, there is no
difficulty in opening the valve; it is when the engineer
wants to close it, that the discomfiture comes in. Some
steam-pipes are provided with a release-valve near the
throttle, to relieve the pipe from intense back-pressure
when the engine is reversed. The sudden reversing of
an engine sometimes jerks this valve out of its seat,
leaving an open passage between the boiler and steam-chest.
This acts like a mild case of unshipped throttle,
and must be controlled in a similar way.</p>

<h3>BURSTING A DRY PIPE.</h3>

<p>The bursting of a dry pipe is similar in effect to the
action of a throttle becoming disconnected while open;
and it may even prove harder to control, according to
the size of the opening. Engineer Halliday had a trying
time with a case of this kind. While swinging
along the E., F., &amp; G. road, with a heavy train of freight,
a herd of horses ran in from an open crossing-gate, and
started up the track just in front of the engine. As<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>167</span>
there was a bridge a short distance ahead, Halliday
reversed the engine in his anxiety to prevent an accident.
The train stopped for an instant, when the engine
began to push it back. Halliday tried to throw
the lever to the center, but never before had he felt
such a pressure acting upon it. Again and again he
tried to throw the lever over; but every time it proved
too formidable a struggle, and the catch found its way
into the full-back notch. Meanwhile, the train was
gaining speed in the wrong direction, and a passenger
train was not many miles behind. Beginning to realize
the true state of affairs, Halliday called for brakes,
opened the fire-box door, closed the dampers, and
started the injector. Then he directed the fireman to
throw some bucketfuls of water upon the fire, while he
tied down the whistle-lever, letting the steam blow.
The promptest means for reducing the pressure of
steam were now in operation, and his next move was to
try the reverse-lever again. Both men grasped the lever,
and, by a combined effort, forced it past the center; and
Samson’s hair was cut. It was afterwards found that a
long rent had opened in the dry pipe, letting the full
boiler pressure upon the valves, which moved hard
through being dry; the hot gases pumped through them
in reverse motion having licked off every trace of lubricating
unguent.</p>

<h3>OTHER THROTTLE ACCIDENTS.</h3>

<p>Cases of serious trouble resulting from accidents to
throttle connections would be easy to multiply. Two
incidents with similar originating conditions, but with
very different results, will suffice. Engineer Phelps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>168</span>
was pulling a full train of coal over rails that were neither
wet nor dry, and had just enough frost upon them
to be wicked. He was having a bad time slipping, but
was working patiently along, when the throttle became
disconnected with the valve open. The engine at once
started on a whirl of slipping that threatened disaster,
but it was immediately controlled by the engineer pulling
the reverse-lever to the center notch. Engineer
Cook of the F., G., &amp; H. road, was not so fortunate
when the stem of his throttle-valve broke on a slippery
day. As the wheels began spinning round, Cook lost
his head, and kept working at the throttle-lever to
try to stop. Seeing this was of no avail, he grasped
the sand-lever, and tugged vigorously at the valves. A
season of tumult succeeded; and, when the engine
stopped presently, it was found to be a deplorable
wreck. It was hard to tell, from the look of the ruin,
what part of the locomotive broke first; but the crank-pins
on one side were cleaned off, and the piston was
out through the cylinder-head. The side-rod on the
other side broke close to the strap, and was twisted up
like a spiral spring.</p>

<h3>POUNDING OF THE WORKING-PARTS.</h3>

<p>It is good for an ambitious young engineer, who
desires to thoroughly master his calling, to walk occasionally
into the room where a well-managed automatic
cut-off engine is at work, and watch its smooth, noise-less
movements. There he may find an ideal of how an
engine should run. The nature of the work performed
by a locomotive engine prevents it from being operated
noiselessly, and the smoothness of its action must always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>169</span>
compare unfavorably with a well-constructed stationary
engine; but the connections which transmit the power
of a locomotive should be free from knock or jar, if they
are properly proportioned, and skillfully put together.</p>

<h3>SOME CAUSES OF POUNDING.</h3>

<p>To an engineer with a well-regulated mind, a pound
about the engine is a source of continual irritation. If
a pound arises from a cause which can be remedied by
an engineer, the careful man will soon perform the
necessary work to end the noise. Sometimes the origin
of a pound is hard to discover: very often it is beyond
the power of the engineer to stop it. Some makes of
locomotives always pound when working in full gear.
With such an engine, a nervous engineer will fuss, pushing
up wedges until they stick fast, and cause no end of
grief to get them down again. He will key up the main-rod
connections till they run hot, and he will prophesy
that the engine is going to pieces. But the engine
hangs together all the same, and is only suffering from
want of lead, or want of compression. Where an engine
is deficient in the cushioning to the piston, due to compression
or lead, the momentum of the piston and connecting-rod
is suddenly checked at the end of each
stroke. The concussion to these working-parts is so
great that pounding will be produced. As the engine
gets hooked towards the center, this pounding will
cease, because the lead opening increases as the motion
is notched back. The most common causes for pounding
with locomotives are worn main-rod connections,
and driving-boxes too loose in the jaws, or the brasses
loose in the driving-boxes. If side-rods are out of tram,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>170</span>
or have the brasses badly worn, they sometimes pound
when passing the centers. A cross-head will pound when
the guides are worn very open. This last defect is liable
to cause a bent piston-rod. A piston makes a tremendous
pound when a badly connected rod allows it to
touch a cylinder-head, and a very ominous pound is produced
when the spider gets loose on the piston-rod, and
a piston-rod loose in the cross-head will make itself
heard all over the engine.</p>

<h3>LOCATING A MYSTERIOUS POUND.</h3>

<p>Several years ago a very troublesome and mysterious
pound caused the writer a great deal of annoyance. He
was running an old engine, with cylinders that had been
bored out until no counter-bore was left. The piston
had worn a seat leaving a small ridge at the end of
its back travel. The main-rod was taken down one day;
and, in putting it up again, the travel of the piston was
slightly altered. The engine started out with a pound,
and kept it up. If any of my readers have been working
an engine that seemed to hang together merely by luck,
away on construction work on the wild prairies, with
no machine-shops in the rear to appeal to for aid or
counsel, with all his own repairing to do without tools
or skilled assistance, they will understand the difficulty
experienced in locating that pound at the back end of
the cylinder.</p>

<p>A cylinder loose on the frame, or a broken frame, will
jar the whole machine; and both of these defects are
serious, and demand increased care in taking the engine
along with the train. Loose driving-box brasses produce
a pound which is sometimes difficult to locate.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>171</span>
In searching for the cause of a pound, it is a good plan
to place the engine with one of the cranks on the quarter,
block the wheels, and have the fireman open the
throttle a little, and reverse the engine with the steam
on. By closely watching in turn each connection, as
the steam through the piston gives a pull or a thrust to
the cross-head, the defect which causes the pound may
be located. Never run with a serious pound inside of a
cylinder. It is an almost certain indication that a smash
is imminent.</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>OFF THE TRACK.—ACCIDENTS TO RUNNING-GEAR.</i></span>
</h2>
</div>

<h3>GETTING DITCHED.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">There</span> is something pathetic in the spectacle of a
noble locomotive, whose speed capabilities are so wonderful,
lying with its wheels in the air, or sunk to the
hubs in mud or gravel. Kindred sights are, a ship
thrown high and dry upon the beach, away from the
element that gives it power and beauty; or a monster
whale, the leviathan of the deep, lying stranded and
helpless upon the shore.</p>

<p>Few engineers have run many years without getting
their engine off the track in some way,—over the ends
of switches, by jumping bad track, or getting into the
ditch through some serious accident, collision or otherwise.
Most of them have felt that shock of the engine
thumping over the ties, and momentarily wondered in
what position it was going to stop; doing all in their
power, meanwhile, to stop, and prevent damage.</p>

<h3>DEALING WITH SUDDEN EMERGENCIES.</h3>

<p>Of course, an engineer’s first duty is to conduct his
engine in a way that will avoid accident so far as human<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>173</span>
foresight can aid in doing so; but, when an accident is
inevitable, his next duty is to use every exertion towards
reducing its severity. The most common form of serious
accident occurring on our railroads is a collision.
Rear-end collisions occur most frequently, although
head-to-head collisions annually claim many victims.
When an accident of this kind is impending, the engineer
generally has but a few seconds of warning; but
these brief seconds well utilized often save many lives,
and impress the principal actor with the stamp of true
heroism. Rounding a curve at a high speed, an engineer
perceives another train approaching. Quick as
thought he shuts off steam, applies the brake, reverses
the engine, and opens the sand-valves and the throttle.
This will take about ten seconds’ time; and, if the engine
is running thirty miles an hour, the train will pass over
forty-four feet each second. Assuming that no reduction
of speed has taken place till all the appliances for
stopping are in operation, four hundred and forty feet
will be passed over as a preliminary to stopping. With
the automatic Westinghouse brake, application and retarding
power are almost simultaneous. Until he has
applied all means of reducing speed, an engineer rarely
or never consults his own safety, however certain death
may be staring him in the face. But after the brakes
are known to be doing their work, aided by sanded rails,
and steam working against the piston, personal safety
is considered. A glance at the position of the two
trains tells if they are coming violently together; and
the engineer jumps off, or remains on the engine, as he
deems best. This applies to trains equipped with continuous
brakes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>174</span></p>

<h3>STOPPING A FREIGHT TRAIN IN CASE OF DANGER.</h3>

<p>With freight trains where the means of stopping are
not immediately under the hand of the engineer, he
must call for brakes on the first indication of danger,
and do all that a reversed engine can achieve to aid in
stopping the train. Where a driver brake is used, the
engineer will have to watch the reversed engine; because
the wheels will soon begin sliding, even on thick
sand, and their retarding power will be seriously diminished.
To prevent this, the engineer should let off the
driver brake, and open the cylinder-cocks, till the wheels
begin to revolve, when the brake may be applied again.
Working and watching in this way greatly assist in
stopping a train, and preventing the flattening of wheels.</p>

<h3>SAVING THE HEATING SURFACES.</h3>

<p>Should the engine get into the ditch, the engineer’s
first duty is to save the engine from getting burned,
unless saving of life, or protecting the train, demands
his attention. If the engine is in a position where the
flues or fire-box crown will be left without water, the
fire should be quenched as quickly as possible. Sand
or gravel thrown over the fire, and then saturated with
water, is a good and prompt way of extinguishing the
fire.</p>

<h3>GETTING THE ENGINE ON THE TRACK.</h3>

<p>It can be understood in a few minutes after derailment
whether or not the engine can be put back on the
track without assistance. Sometimes a pull from another
engine is all that is required: again, nothing can
be done without the aid of heavy tools to raise it up.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>175</span>
In this case, no time should be lost in sending for the
wrecking outfit. It often happens that an engine gets
off the track while switching among sidings, and sinks
down in the road-bed so as to be helpless. In an event
of this kind, jacking up a few inches will often enable
the engine to work back to the rails. Before beginning
to hoist with the screw-jacks, some labor can generally
be saved by putting pieces of iron between the bottom
of the driving-boxes and the pedestal-braces. As the
wheels begin to rise out of the gravel, pieces of plank
or wooden wedges should be driven under them to hold
good every inch raised. Where the attempt is made to
work an engine on the rails by means of wrecking-frogs,
wooden filling should be laid down crosswise to prevent
the wheels from sinking between the ties, should they
slip off the frogs. Where jacking up has to be resorted
to, there is often difficulty experienced in getting up the
engine-truck; as raising the frame usually leaves the
truck behind in the mire. The best plan is, to jack up
the front of the engine to the desired level, then with a
rail well manned pry up the truck, and hold it in position
by driving shims under the wheels. An engine will
generally go on the rails easiest the way it comes off.</p>

<p>When a derailed engine is being pulled on the track
by another engine, the work should be done carefully,
and with proper deliberation. When every thing is
made ready for a pull, some men act as if the best plan
was to start both engines off with full throttle; and this
often leaves the situation worse than it was at first.
When truck-wheels stand at an angle to the track, it is
often necessary to jerk them in line by attaching a
chain or rope to one side. A wrecking-frog should be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>176</span>
laid in front of the wheel outside the rail, and blocking
before the inside wheel, sufficient to raise the tread of
the wheel above the level of the rail. Then move ahead
slowly, and the chances are that the wheels will go on
the rails. Sometimes the easiest way is to open the
track at a joint, move it aside to the line of the wheels,
and spike it there, then draw or run the engine on.</p>

<p>Having an engine off the track, is a position where
good judgment is more potent than a volume of written
directions.</p>

<h3>UNDERSTANDING THE RUNNING-GEAR.</h3>

<p>The driving-wheels, axles, boxes, frames, with the
trucks and all their attachments, are somewhat dirty
articles to handle. The examination of how they are
put together, and how they are hanging together, is pursued
under soiling circumstances. Perhaps this is the
reason these things are studied less than they ought to
be. To creep under a greasy locomotive to examine
wheels, axles, and truck-boxes, is not a dignified proceeding
by any means; but it is a very useful one. The
running-gear is the fundamental part of the machine,
and its whole make-up should be thoroughly understood.
The builds of trucks are so multifarious that no specified
directions can be given respecting accidents happening
to them. There is, therefore, the greater need
for an engineer’s familiarizing himself with the make-up
of his running-gear, so that, when an accident happens,
he will know exactly what to do. Disraeli said:
“There is nothing so likely to happen as the unexpected.”
This applies very aptly to railroad engineering.
Industrious accumulation of knowledge respecting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>177</span>
every part of the machine is the proper way to defy the
unexpected.</p>

<h3>BROKEN DRIVING-SPRING.</h3>

<p>The running-gear of some engines is so arranged, that,
in case a driving-spring breaks on the road, it can readily
be replaced if a spare spring is carried. With the average
run of engines, however, and the accumulating complication
of brake-gear attached to the frames, the replacing
of a driving-spring is a tedious operation, that
would involve too much delay with an engine attached
to a train. Consequently engineers seldom attempt to
change a broken spring. They merely remove the attachments
likely to shake out of place, and block the
engine up so as to get home safely. When a forward
driving-spring breaks, it is generally best to take the
spring out with its saddle and hangers. Then run
the back drivers up on wedges to take the weight off
the forward drivers, and put a piece of hard wood or a
rubber spring between the top of the box and the frame.
Now run the forward drivers on the wedges, which
will take the weight off the back drivers, and with a
pinch-bar pry up the end of the equalizer till that lever
stands level, and block it in that position by jamming a
piece of wood between it and the frame. For a back
driving-spring, this order of procedure should be reversed.
A back driving-spring is often hard to get out
of its position; and it sometimes can be left in place,
as it is not very liable to cause mischief.</p>

<p>Where a spring drops its load through a hanger
breaking, the mishap can occasionally be remedied by
chaining the spring to the frame. Should this prove<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>178</span>
impracticable, the same process must be followed as
that which was made necessary by a broken spring.</p>

<h3>EQUALIZER BROKEN.</h3>

<p>For a broken equalizer, all the pieces likely to shake
off, or to be caught by the revolving wheels, must come
out; and both driving-boxes on that side must be blocked
on top with wood or rubber. Where good screw-jacks
are carried, it will often prove time-saving to raise the
engine by jacking up at the back end of the frame instead
of running it up on wedges. Where the wedge
plan is likely to prove easiest, it must be adopted only
on a straight track; and then too much care can not be
used to prevent the wheels from leaving the rails.</p>

<h3>ACCIDENTS TO TRUCKS.</h3>

<p>The breaking of an engine-truck spring which transmits
the weight to the boxes by means of an equalizer,
requires that the equalizer should be taken out, and the
frame blocked above the boxes. This blocking above
the boxes is necessary to prevent the two unyielding
iron surfaces, which would otherwise come together,
from hammering each other to pieces. Wood or rubber
has more elasticity, and acts as a spring. Whatever
may be the form of truck used, if the breaking of a
spring allows the rigid frame to drop upon the top of
one or more boxes, it must be raised, and a yielding substance
inserted, if the engine is to be run even at a moderate
speed, and the engineer wishes to avoid further
breakage. Sometimes truck-springs, especially with
tanks, are so arranged that the removal of one will take
away the support of the frame at that point. In such a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>179</span>
case, a cross-tie or other suitable piece of wood must be
fitted into the place to support the weight which the
spring held up.</p>

<h3>BROKEN FRAME.</h3>

<p>A broken truck-frame can generally be held together
by means of a chain, and a piece of broken rail or wooden
beam to act as a “splice.” Should a truck-wheel or
axle break, it can be chained up to enable the engine
to reach the nearest side track where new wheels may
be procured, or the broken parts fastened so that the
engine may proceed carefully home. The back wheel
of an engine-truck can be chained up securely to a rail
or cross-tie placed across the top of the engine-frame.
If an accident happens to the front wheels, and it proves
impracticable to get a sound pair, the truck should be
turned round when a side track is reached. An accident
to the wheels or axle of a tender-truck can be managed
in the same way as an engine-truck, but the cross-beam
to support the chained weight must be placed
across the top of the tender. A bent axle or broken
wheel that prevents a truck from following the rail, can
be run to the nearest side track by fastening the wheels
so that they will slide on the rails.</p>

<h3>BROKEN DRIVING AXLES, WHEELS, AND TIRES.</h3>

<p>Accidents of this nature often disable the engine entirely;
but sometimes the breakage occurs in such a way
that the engine can run itself home, or into a side track,
by good and careful management. Driving-axles generally
break in the box, or between the box and the
wheel. When this happens to a main driving-axle, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>180</span>
when any thing happens to the forward driving-wheel
or tire of such a serious nature that the engine can not
be moved until the wheel is raised away from the rail,
the engineer’s first duty is to take down the main rod
on that side, and secure the piston, then to take down
both of the side rods. Cases could be cited where engineers
have brought in engines with broken axles without
disconnecting any thing, but these men did not take
the safe side by a long way.</p>

<p>The rods being disconnected, run the disabled wheel
up on a wedge or block of wood, and secure it in the
raised position by driving blocking between the axle-box
and the pedestal-brace. To get the box high
enough in the jaws, it is sometimes necessary to remove
the spring and saddle from the top of the box. A
wheel may break and not fall to pieces, but still be dangerous
to use, except for moving along slowly. A tire
may break, and yet remain on the wheel, only requiring
the most careful handling. On the other hand, the
breaking of a wheel or tire may render the wheel useless,
when it must be raised from the rail the same way
as was recommended for a broken axle, and the same
precautions in regard to stripping that side of the engine
must all be taken. In the event of an accident
happening which disables both forward drivers, they
must both be raised from the rails, and the engine pulled
in, the truck and hind drivers supporting the weight.
Both side rods must come down.</p>

<p>The breaking of back driving-axles, or accidents to
wheels or tires, is very difficult to manage; because the
weight must be supported in some way. The first act
when such a mishap occurs, is to take down both side<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>181</span>
rods. If the engine can be moved to the nearest side
track without further change, take it there; now jack
up the back part of the engine, and fasten two pieces of
rail by chaining or otherwise to the frames of the engine,
their ends resting on the tank-deck, so that, when
the jacks are lowered, the tank will help to support the
hind part of the engine.</p>

<p>I have seen a case where one piece of rail was pushed
into the draw-bar casting, and it held the engine up
through a journey of seventy miles. If one of the back
driving-wheels can be used, it lessens the weight that
has to be borne by any lever contrivance. When one
wheel is disabled, it must be blocked up in the jaws;
and, should both wheels be rendered useless, they must
both be held up, so that as much as possible of the
weight may be thrown upon the forward drivers.</p>

<h3>CARE OF LOCOMOTIVE RODS.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">When</span> it is found that an engineer runs his engine for
months on arduous train service, and has no trouble with
his rods, he may safely be credited with knowing his
business, and attending to it skillfully. In regard to the
keeping of the machinery in working-order, the engineer’s
duties are mostly of a supervisory nature. When
piston-rings get blowing, when guides need closing, or
when a pump gets working badly, he reports the matter;
and the work is done so that the defect is remedied.
With the rods it is different. Although he does not file
the brasses himself, he exerts great influence, for good
or evil, in the way he manipulates the keys, and by the
care he takes of the rods. Injudicious keying of rods
is responsible for more accidents than the mistakes in
any other one direction, with, perhaps, the exception of
the current mistake of the hind brakeman, who supposes
there is no use in going back to flag when his train has
stopped between stations.</p>

<h3>FUNCTIONS OF CONNECTING-RODS.</h3>

<p>The functions of rods being to transmit the motion of
the pistons to the running-gear, they have very heavy
duty to perform. The conflicting strains and shocks to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>183</span>
which a locomotive is subjected while running over a
rough track at high speed, are, in many instances, sustained
by the rods: hence it is of special importance
that this portion of the motion should be kept in good
order. Main rods convey the power developed in the
cylinders to the crank-pins by a succession of pulls and
thrusts equal in vigor to the aggregate of steam-pressure
exerted on the piston. To endure this alternating
tension and compression without injury to the working-parts,
it is of the utmost importance that the connections
should be close fitted, yet free enough to prevent
unnecessary friction. In fitting up main-rod brasses, it
does not matter in what position the crank stands, so
long as it is convenient for doing the work. But, if the
engine has been in service since the pins were turned,
they should be calipered through their horizontal diameter
when the crank is on the center; since it is well
known that the pins have a tendency to wear flat on the
sides at right angles to the crank’s length. The back
ends of the main-rod brasses should be fitted brass to
brass; for that form of doing the work makes the most
secure job, and gives the connection all the advantages
of a solid box, preventing the straps and brasses from
being knocked out of shape by hammering each other,—a
result that surely follows the open brasses method of
fitting back ends of main-rods. Leaving the forward
end brasses a little open is not injurious to that connection,
because the line of strain is not so varied as that
of the back end.</p>

<h3>EFFECTS OF BAD FITTING.</h3>

<p>When the work of fitting a set of back-end brasses is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>184</span>
completed, they should be put in the strap, and tried on
the pin. If, after being keyed close together, they revolve
on the pin without pinching, the fit is not too
tight. It is of the greatest consequence, in fitting rod-brasses,
to ascertain, beyond doubt, that the brasses have
been bored out true, and that they fit in the strap so
that the line of strain shall be in line with the cross-head
and crank-pins. It occasionally happens, through bad
workmanship, that when the back end of a rod is keyed
up, and the front end not connected, the rod does
not point straight to the cross-head pin, but in a line
some distance to the right or left. The distance may
be very small, yet sufficient to cause no small amount
of trouble. By some pinching and jamming, a rod in
this condition can be connected up; but it is almost
sure to run hot. And a rod in this condition will never
run satisfactorily till it is taken down and fitted by a
competent machinist. The back end may be all right,
and the forward end suffering from oblique fitting.
This is even more common than the first case, and the
effect is the same. A rod in this condition, besides
displaying a tendency to run hot, will keep jerking the
cross-head from side to side on the guides, and will
probably make the cross-head chafe the guides at certain
points. Rods never run cool, and free from jar,
unless they are fitted to transmit the power in a direct
line between the pins.</p>

<h3>STRIKING POINTS AND CLEARANCE.</h3>

<p>Before putting up main rods, the striking points of
the pistons should be located and marked on the guides.
Then, when the rods are put up, the clearance should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>185</span>
be divided equally between the two ends. The identification
of these points is of greater interest to the engineer
who is running the engine than to any other
person; for upon their correctness the success of his
running may, to some extent, depend. An engine may
go out with the clearance badly divided, and run all
right for a few days, and the driving of a key may then
cause the piston to strike the head. A forcible instance
of this kind once came under my observation. A careless
machinist, in working on main-rod brasses, had
mixed the liners, and shortened the rod, till the piston
began to touch the back head. When the engine was
working light, there was just a slight jar; but, when the
load was heavy, the jar became a distinct pound. The
engineer could not locate the knock, and was disposed
to think it was in the driving-box. One day that he
slipped the engine badly, steam began to issue from the
back cylinder-head, which was cracked by a blow from
the piston. The cause of the pound was then discovered.</p>

<h3>WATCHING RODS ON THE ROAD.</h3>

<p>When an engineer starts out with an engine after
the rod-brasses have been filed, he should make them a
special object of attention. If he can not shake the connection
laterally with his hands when there is room for
movement within the collars, he should slack up the
key till he can do so; for some one has made a mistake
in fitting. So long as the rod passes the center without
jar when the engine is working hard in full gear, the
brasses are tight enough. After running a few miles
with newly fitted brasses, the rod will generally need<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>186</span>
keying up; for liners that were comparatively loose
when put up, get driven compactly together, leaving
lost motion. Although a connection may be put together
brass to brass, there is still some work left for
the engineer to do in the way of keying. To do keying
correctly needs considerable sagacity, especially in the
case of side rods. In the case of back ends of main
rods, the key should be got down as soon as possible,
to hold the brasses immovably in the strap; but, after
this point is reached, there should be no more hammering
on the key. Some men persist in pounding down
keys that are already snug, and the effect of their blows
is to spring the brass out of shape. A key acts as a
wedge, which it is; and, when the taper is slight, the
blow imparted by a hammer roughly used, exerts an
immense force in driving it down. Something must
yield; and the brass gets sprung towards the pin, presenting
a ridge for a rubbing surface, which heats, and
causes delay. After the key is once driven tight home,
its work is finished. If the pin then indicates lost motion,
the rod should be taken down, and the brasses
reduced. In the case of main rods, this should be done
at the first signs of pounding; for lost motion entails
heavy shocks upon the moving parts. The front end
of main rods requires to be very carefully watched, and
the connection kept free from jar. Where this part is
kept regularly oiled, and free from lost motion, it gives
scarcely any trouble; but let the wrist-pin of the common
cross-head once get cut through neglect, and it is
a difficult matter getting it in good running-order again.
The style of cross-head where the pin is part of the
casting, although greatly used, is a most awkward article<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>187</span>
to fit up and keep in shape. The form of cross-head
which works between two guide-bars, and has its axis
in line with the piston-rod, is becoming deservedly
popular.</p>

<h3>SIDE RODS.</h3>

<p>Many attempts have been made to dispense with
side rods, and they certainly are a troublesome part of
the machinery to keep right; but no better means of
connecting driving-wheels has yet been devised. The
first method of coupling driving-wheels together, so that
more than one pair might be available for adhesion, was
by means of cogs and gearing. This was improved on
by an endless chain working over pocketed pulleys; but
even this was an extremely crude device,—working
with tumultuous jerks, and a noise like a stamping-mill.
One of the first real improvements, which George Stephenson
effected on the locomotive, was the inventing
of side rods. An essential element in locomotive construction
needed to make side rods run with safety, is,
that all the wheels connected shall be of the same circumference.
There is a practice on some roads of putting
new tires on wheels just as they come from the
rolling-mill, without putting them in the lathe. Such
tires are seldom accurate in size; and they cause no
end of trouble, especially to side rods. This is one of
the economical practices that does not pay.</p>

<h3>ADJUSTMENT OF SIDE RODS.</h3>

<p>To connect driving-wheels so that they will run together
in perfect harmony, after ascertaining that they
are the same size, the next point is to secure the crank-pins<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>188</span>
at an equal distance from the centers of the wheels.
When this is done, and the wheels are trammed parallel
to the line of motion, the rods will move on a plane with
the centers of the crank-pins exactly the same distance
apart as are the centers of the driving-axles. The rods
can be adjusted to the greatest advantage with the
steam raised, so that the heat of the boiler will make
the frames about the same length as when the engine
is at work. The expansion due to the heat of the boiler
is short when measured by a foot-rule, but it affects
the smooth action of the side rods to a remarkable
extent.</p>

<p>Before tramming for the side rods, it is necessary to
have the driving-box wedges set up just tight enough to
let the driving-boxes move vertically in the jaws without
sticking. The distance between the centers of the driving-axles
and the centers of the crank-pins having now
been found equal, the rods are fitted up; each connection
being secured a close fit to the pin, with the brasses held
brass to brass. With the brasses bored out exactly to
the size of the crank-pins, and the rods accurately fitted,
a connection could be made which would bind the two
sets of drivers to move as an unbroken unit, were it not
for the disturbing element which appears in the shape
of rough track. With uneven track and worn wheel-tires,
a tremendous tension is put on the rods where the
connections are closely fitted. Provision is made for
this source of danger by leaving the brasses of the back
pins loosely fitted. A yielding space is left between the
brass and the pin, not between the brass and the key or
strap. The latter connections must be perfectly snug,
or the strap will soon be pounded out of shape.</p>

<p>In the case of ten-wheel and consolidation engines,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>189</span>
the brasses of all wheels behind the leading pair should
be bored out one-sixty-fourth larger than the pins, which
will generally be sufficient. In case a pin is sprung,—which
is no rare circumstance,—room enough must be
left in the brass to let the pin pass over its tightest
point without pinching. The center is the proper position
to put up side rods on. Some men like to fit side
rods with the cranks on the eighths position; holding
that there the greatest strain comes on, and, consequently,
that there fitting up should be done. That is
a mistaken idea; for rods may be put together on the
eighths, and yet bind the pins badly in passing the
centers. On the other hand, if they pass the centers
easily, they will go round the remainder of the circle
without danger.</p>

<h3>KEYING SIDE RODS.</h3>

<p>When it is necessary for an engineer to key up side
rods, he should select a place where the track is straight,
and as even as possible. Then he should put the cranks
on the center, and take care that he can move the connections
laterally after the job is done. If he now
moves the engine so that the cranks are on the other
center, and finds that the rod connections can still be
moved, that side is all right. If the other side be
treated in a similar manner, his rods are not likely to
give trouble. With a worn-out engine and rough road-bed,
it is a difficult matter to preserve the true mean between
loose and tight side-rod connections. But, in a
case of doubt, the loose side is the safe side. Yet most
engineers are inclined to err on the side of danger,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>190</span>
for they will generally tighten up the rods to prevent
them from rattling. On a Western road, where solid-ended
brasses were adopted, it was often amusing to
hear the engineers protesting against the noise the side
rods made when the brasses began to get worn. They
would rattle from one end of the division to the other;
but they would not break pins, or fracture themselves,
and tear the cab to pieces, or ditch a train, as happens
so often from other rods being keyed to prevent noise.
Sprung crank-pins and broken side rods are very often
the result of injudicious keying.</p>

<h3>DIFFICULTY IN LOCATING DEFECTS.</h3>

<p>A locomotive has so many parts that bear a close
relation to each other, and that are so sympathetic when
one of the parts becomes disordered, that it is sometimes
a difficult matter to immediately locate a complaint.
One of the signs of a defect, in many of the
parts, or one of the consequences of it, is a “pound,”—a
complaint that we hear of in a locomotive about as
frequently, and with the same feeling, as we do of
malaria in the individual.</p>

<h3>POUNDING IN DRIVING-BOXES AND WEDGES.</h3>

<p>But we will deal now with the pounds in a locomotive,
and will take the location in which we find the
most and serious ones,—namely, in the driving-boxes
and wedges,—and see why they pound, and what will
prevent them from doing so. The cause we will find,
if in the wedges, is due to a rocking of the box in them,
or from causes arising from imperfect fitting when they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>191</span>
were put up, or lined up when the engine was in the
shop. This fitting of wedges on a locomotive that has
done service is a matter of importance in the immediate
present and future working of the parts themselves, and
of other parts of the locomotive as well. On stripping
a locomotive that has done much service, it will be
found that the working of the wedges on the face of the
pedestal has worn it hollow, or pounded furrows on it,
or has done both. This occurs so frequently on the
“live” wedge side, that it may be taken as the rule,
rather than the exception, to find the pedestal in this
condition. While it does not happen so frequently on
the “dead” wedge side as on the other, it will be found
there also if the wedge has not been held by a fastening
to the pedestal, or securely fitted between the top of the
frame and the pedestal binder-brace. These defects
will be found on the back of the wedge also, and are
produced by the same cause and same motion as those
on the pedestal face. These defects are the most frequent
cause of the driving-box pounding, or of the
wedges rocking; since thereby the wedges get thrown
out of parallel to each other, when it becomes necessary
to adjust them during the service of the locomotive.</p>

<p>In refitting wedges, these defects should be removed,
the pedestal face carefully straightened its entire length,
and the wedge-back fitted to it. It is not only necessary
that the pedestal face should be smooth, but that
it should be straight its entire length. If not, when it
becomes necessary to adjust the wedge, if the pedestal
is high on the top end, the wedge is thrown out at the
top, binding the box at that point, and allowing it to
swing at the bottom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>192</span></p>

<h3>IMPORTANCE OF HAVING WEDGES PROPERLY FITTED.</h3>

<p>With the pedestal face in a proper condition to avoid
displacement of the wedge, when moved to different
positions on it, we should consider what will be the
method of lining the wedges, and what duty they have
to perform. This duty is merely to take up the lost
motion between the pedestal and boxes; and that, from
their shape, they readily do from time to time. While
this duty is simple, the wedges ought to do it without
affecting any of the other parts of the locomotive,—a
condition of perfection that can be reached only by
having all the wedges perfectly parallel with the pedestals
and with each other. If the first condition is not
complied with, the result, as stated, will be the box
swinging in the wedges. If the latter, then with the
varying position of the boxes in the pedestal due to the
engine settling on the springs, or to the change of position
from the motion of the springs when the locomotive
is running, we will have a varying distance between the
centers of the wheels and length for the side rods.</p>

<p>Many of the complaints we hear of rods not working
properly, are owing to this defect in wedges not being
parallel, by which the distances are varied, and a strain
thrown upon the rods that not only affects them, but
causes them in turn to bind the boxes against the wedges
by trying to compress or extend to a length varying as
often as the motion of the springs. While the motion
of the springs is not much in proportion to the length of
the wedges, and the varying distance between centers of
wheels is in ratio to that proportion, if the wedges are
not parallel, we must remember how often the motion is
occurring, and that, no matter how slight the strain upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>193</span>
the rods may be, we are putting it on a part of the locomotive
that requires the minutest adjustment to enable
it to do its work properly and safely.</p>

<h3>INFLUENCE OF HALF-ROUND BRASSES.</h3>

<p>Driving-boxes fitted with a half-round brass have a
tendency to close at the bottom. This tendency is continuous,
and becomes most marked as the brass wears
down, relieving the box of the strain put upon it by the
tight-fitting brass. With a properly fitted brass, and a
collar put up in good shape, the box can not close much:
still, there will be enough looseness to cause a slight
pounding. During the first few days’ service of a locomotive
after new driving-brasses of this shape are put in,
the compression on the brass, resulting from the weight
of the engine, tends to close the bottom of the box, and
permits the box to rock. This evil may be, to some
extent, prevented by fitting the wedges slightly closer
at the bottom. This closing of the box at the bottom
is not only an evil and annoyance in itself by causing
pounding, but is a further source of trouble by hastening
the forming of a shoulder on the top of the wedge.
The tendency at all times is for the axle-box to wear a
shoulder at the top and bottom of its travel, even when
the box retains its proper shape; but, when it is distorted
by closing at the bottom, the rubbing surfaces
are put out of the true plane, and wear takes place much
more rapidly. While the springs retain their position,
and impart to the axle-box a fixed range of motion, no
serious effect is felt from the worn wedges. But when
the locomotive is passing over rough frogs or bad rail-joints,
where the motion of the spring is increased, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>194</span>
frame pounds down upon the box, which for a moment
becomes fastened in the narrow space between the
shoulders of the wedges; and an effort is needed for the
box to relieve itself, and allow the spring to resume its
motion. This causes the engine to ride hard in some
instances, where the condition of the track makes the
box catch frequently. Sometimes the box will be unable
to relieve itself without assistance, and much loss
of time and annoyance result when the wedge has to
be pulled down to relieve the box.</p>

<p>The forming of the shoulder on top and bottom of the
wedge may be anticipated and prevented by planing
the part where the ridges form, leaving a face just the
length of the box plus the space covered by the motion
of the springs. Not only does this aid in preventing
the box from forming a shoulder, but it also reduces the
first cost of fitting the wedges by reducing the surface
to be squared and finished true.</p>

<h3>POSITION OF BOXES WHILE SETTING UP WEDGES.</h3>

<p>With the wedges in a proper condition when the locomotive
enters service, we yet must care for them and
adjust them from time to time, when it is necessary to
take up the lost motion between the pedestals and
boxes. When doing this work, it is important that the
position and condition of the driving-box should be considered.
The position of the box should be such that
the wedge may be set up to the proper degree of tightness
with certainty and without much labor. It is important
that a wheel position be found where the box
would not be moved by the wedge when the latter is
being adjusted. This position will be found where the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>195</span>
box is up against the dead wedge, since the lost motion
will then be between the box and the wedge to be
moved. To get all the driving-boxes in that position at
one time is a difficult matter, if it is to be done by pinching
the wheels. The position of the rods decides the
direction of their action on the wheel by the thrust or
pull upon the crank-pin. If the rod is above the wheel
center, pinching behind the back wheel will force both
the wheels and boxes on that side up against the dead
wedge; but, should the rod be below the wheel center,
similar work with the pinch-bar will draw the forward
box away from the dead wedge, the side rod doing this
by pulling on the crank-pin,—this is always supposing
the dead wedge to be in the front pedestals. The best
position, therefore, to get an engine into for setting up
all the wedges, is, with the side rods on the upper
eighths; for then pinching behind the back wheels will
push all the boxes up to the dead wedges. The work
can then be done without putting unnecessary strain
upon the wedge-bolts, which are often found with the
corners of the heads rounded off, and the thread injured
to such an extent that it will not screw through the
binder-brace,—a condition of matters nearly always
caused by trying to force up wedges without putting
the engine in the proper position. If the wedge-bolt,
from faulty construction, or through injury, is unable to
move up the wedge, driving is resorted to, by which
means it is battered on the end; and the jarring of each
blow causes the ashes and dirt on top to fall behind the
wedge, throwing it out of parallel, and introducing material
that will cause the wedge to cut. The ashes and
dirt that accumulate so readily on the top of wedges<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>196</span>
and boxes cause no end of trouble, although the fact is
not generally recognized; and it will generally be fruitful
labor to have these parts well cleaned off before beginning
to set up wedges. Many complaints that are
made, of wedges not being properly adjusted, proceed
from the disturbance that follows grit introduced between
the wedge and box.</p>

<h3>NECESSITY FOR KEEPING BOXES AND WEDGES CLEAN.</h3>

<p>The growing practice of close and stated inspection
of locomotives to detect defects, before waiting for them
to develop into breakages that cause trouble and delay
to trains, will give especially good results if applied to
boxes and wedges. If the wedges are taken down and
examined at regular intervals, the ridges that appear so
readily on the face, when oil-grooves are cut on the sides
of the driving-box, can be smoothed off before they cause
distortion of the surface. This is also a good time for a
thorough cleaning of the pedestals and box, and the oil-holes
can be examined and opened out properly. Work
of this kind often prevents boxes getting hot on the
road, with all the entailed delay and expense, which
frequently include changing engines if the train must
be pushed on. One turn of a hot box will often wear a
brass more than the daily running for two years.</p>

<h3>TEMPERATURE OF THE BOX TO BE CONSIDERED.</h3>

<p>One condition of the box to be considered, when adjusting
wedges, is its temperature at the time the work
is done, and what that will be when the engine is in
service. Adjusting wedges is often done as a preliminary
step to lining and adjusting side rods; and this is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>197</span>
done, on many roads, on the shop-day when the locomotive
is in for washing out and periodical repairs. At
that time, the engine being cold, the boxes will be at
their lowest temperature, and, consequently, at their
smallest dimensions. Allowance should then be made
with the wedges for some expansion of the boxes. Another
condition that should be considered, is how the
box has been running. A box that has been running
hot or warm, generally compels the wedge to be lowered
to allow for extra expansion. When this box has
been repacked, or otherwise cared for, the wedge is
again set up. While doing this, it should be remembered
that a box that has been running hot is liable to
be distorted, and its journal bearing injured, so that it is
likely to run warm for some time, till the brass comes
to a smooth bearing. If the wedge will not permit the
box to expand, it binds the journal, and is likely to run
still hotter, and is liable to stick in the jaws.</p>

<h3>SMALL DISORDERS THAT CAUSE ROUGH RIDING.</h3>

<p>Many complaints are made about pounds in driving-boxes
and wedges, when the trouble really exists elsewhere.
Boxes with driving-spring saddles whose foot is
but the width of the top or spring-band, will oft-times, if
the band is not rounded where it rides on the saddle, or
is not fitted with a pin or other center bearing, tip on
the box with each motion of the spring. Or, if the
saddle is moved from its worn seat on the top of the box,
it will rock and pound. Again, obstructions in the bearing
of the spring equalizer that will prevent the full
motion of the springs, and bring them to a sudden stop,
will produce a motion resembling that caused by a stuck<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>198</span>
box. Attention to details that are sometimes considered
the crude parts of a locomotive, will often prove
highly beneficial to the working of the locomotive; and
especially is this the case with the parts that transmit
the motion of the springs.</p>

</div>

<h3>THE LOCOMOTIVE SLIDE-VALVE.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> nature of the service required of locomotive
engines, especially those employed on fast-train service,
makes it necessary that the steam-distribution gear
shall be free from complication; and, for convenience
in working the engine, it is essential that means should
be provided for reversing the motion promptly, without
endangering the working-parts. The valve-gear should
also be capable of regulating the admission and exhaust
of steam, so that the engine shall be able to maintain
a high rate of speed, or to exert a great tractive force.
These features are admirably combined in the valve-gear
of the ordinary locomotive. Designers of this
form of engine have given great consideration to the
merit of simplicity. Numerous attempts have been
made to displace the common D slide-valve, but every
move in that direction has ended in failure.</p>

<h3>INVENTION AND APPLICATION OF THE SLIDE-VALVE.</h3>

<p>The slide-valve, in a crude form, was invented by
Matthew Murray of Leeds, England, towards the end
of last century; and it was subsequently improved by
Watt to the D form. It received but little application<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>200</span>
in England till the locomotive era. Oliver Evans of
Philadelphia appears to have perceived the advantages
possessed by the slide-valve, for he used it on engines
he designed years before locomotives came into service.
The D slide-valve was better adapted for high-speed
engines than any thing tried during our early engineering
days, but it was on locomotives where it first
properly demonstrated its real value. The period of
necessity brought the slide-valve into prominence; and
the galaxy of mechanical genius that heralded the locomotive
into successful operation recognized its most
valuable features, and it soon obtained exclusive possession
of that form of engine. Through good and evil
report, and against many attempts to displace it, the
slide-valve has retained a monopoly of high-speed reversible
engines.</p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION OF THE SLIDE-VALVE.</h3>

<p>The slide-valve in common use is practically an oblong
cast-iron box, which rests and moves on the valve-seat.
In the valve-seat, separated by partitions called
bridges, are three ports, those at the ends being the
openings of the passages for conveying steam to and
from the cylinders, while the middle port is in communication
with the blast-pipe, which conveys the exhausted
steam to the atmosphere. On the under side
of the valve is a semicircular cavity, which spans the
exhaust-port and the bridges when the valve stands in
its central position. When the steam within the cylinder
has performed its duty of pushing the piston
towards the end of the stroke, the valve cavity moves
over the steam-port, and allows the steam to pass into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>201</span>
the exhaust-port, thence into the exhaust-pipe. The
cavity under the valve thus acts as a door for the
escape of the exhaust steam. This is a very convenient
and simple method of educting the steam; and
the process helps to balance the valve, since the rush
of escaping steam striking the under part of the valve
tends to counteract the pressure that the steam in the
steam-chest continually exerts on the top of the valve.</p>

<h3>PRIMITIVE SLIDE-VALVE.</h3>

<div id="i_6" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24em;">
  <img src="images/i_p201.png" width="378" height="192" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span></div></div>

<p>In its primitive form, the slide-valve was made merely
long enough to cover the steam-ports when placed in
the central position, as shown in <a href="#i_6">Fig. 6</a>. With a valve
of this form, the slightest movement had the effect of
opening one end so that steam would be admitted to
the cylinder, while the other end opened the exhaust.
By such an arrangement, steam was necessarily admitted
to the cylinder during the whole length of the
stroke; since closing at one end meant opening at the
other. There were several serious objections to this
system. It was very difficult to give the engine cushion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>202</span>
enough to help the cranks over the centers without
pounding, and a small degree of lost motion was sufficient
to make the steam obstruct the piston during a
portion of the stroke. But the most serious drawback
to the short valve was, that it permitted no advantage
to be taken of the expansive power of steam. For
several years after the advent of the locomotive, the
boiler pressure used seldom exceeded fifty pounds to
the square inch. With this tension of steam, there
was little work to be got from expansion with the
conditions under which locomotives were worked; but,
so soon as higher pressures began to be introduced,
the loss of heat entailed by permitting the full-pressure
steam to follow the piston to the end of the stroke
became too great to continue without an attempted
remedy. A very simple change served to remedy this
defect, and to render the slide-valve worthy of a prominent
place among mechanical appliances for saving
power.</p>

<h3>OUTSIDE LAP.</h3>

<p>The change referred to, which so greatly enhanced
the efficiency of the slide-valve, consisted in lengthening
the valve-face, so that, when the valve stood in the
center of the seat, the edges of the valve extended a
certain distance over the induction ports, as in <a href="#i_7">Fig. 7</a>.
This extension of the valve is called outside lap, or
simply lap. The effect of lap is to close the steam-port
before the piston reaches the end of the stroke, and
the point at which the steam-port is closed is known as
the point of cut-off. When the steam is cut off, and
confined within the cylinder, it pushes the piston along<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>203</span>
by its expansive energy, doing work with heat that
would be lost were the cylinder left in communication
with the steam-chest till the end of the stroke.</p>

<div id="i_7" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24em;">
  <img src="images/i_p203.png" width="375" height="195" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span></div></div>

<p>When a slide-valve is actuated by an eccentric connected
directly with the rocker-arm or valve-stem, the
point of cut-off caused by the extent of lap, remains
the same till a change is made on the valve, or on the
throw of the eccentric, unless an independent cut-off
valve be employed. Locomotives having the old hook
motion worked under this disadvantage; because the
hook could not vary the travel of the valve, which is
the method usually resorted to for producing a variable
cut-off. The link and other simple expansion gears
perform their office of varying the cut-off in this way.</p>

<h3>SOME EFFECTS OF LAP.</h3>

<p>In addition to cutting off admission of steam before
the end of the stroke, lap requires the valve to be set
in such a way that it has also the effect of leading to
the exhaust-port being opened before the end of the
stroke. The point where the exhaust is opened is usually
known as the point of release. The change which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>204</span>
causes release to happen before the piston completes
its stroke, leads to the closure of the exhaust-port
before the end of the return stroke is reached, which
imprisons the steam remaining in the cylinder, causing
compression. Where a valve has no inside lap, release
and compression happen simultaneously; that is, the
port at one end of the cylinder is opened to release
the steam, and that at the other end is closed, letting
the piston compress any steam remaining in the
cylinder into the space left as piston clearance.</p>

<h3>INSIDE LAP.</h3>

<p>In some cases the inside edges of the valve cavity
do not reach the edges of the steam-ports when the
valve is on the middle of the seat, but lap over on the
bridge a certain distance, as shown by the dotted lines
in <a href="#i_7">Fig. 7</a>. This is called inside lap, and its effect upon
the distribution of steam is to delay the release. By
this means it prolongs the period of expansion, and
hastens compression on the return stroke. Inside lap
is an advantage only with slow-working engines. When
high speed is attempted with engines having much
inside lap, the steam does not have enough time to
escape from the cylinders, and the back pressure and
compression become so great as to be very detrimental
to the working of the engine. As locomotive engineers
have it, the engine is “logy.”</p>

<h3>THE EXTENT OF LAP USUALLY ADOPTED.</h3>

<p>In locomotive practice, the extent of lap varies according
to the character of service the engine is intended
to perform. With American standard gauge engines,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>205</span>
the lap varies from ½ inch to 1¼ inch. For high-speed
engines, the extent of lap ranges from ⅞ to 1¼. Freight
engines commonly get ⅝ to ¾ outside lap, and from 1/16 to
¼ inside lap. With a given travel, the greater the lap
the longer will the period for expansion be.</p>

<h3>FIRST APPLICATION OF LAP.</h3>

<p>Lap was applied to the slide-valve in this country
before its advantage as an element of economy was
understood in Europe. As early as 1829, James of
New York used lap on the valves of an engine used
to run a steam-carriage; and in 1832 Mr. Charles W.
Copeland put a lap-valve on a steamboat engine, and
his father understood that its advantage was in providing
for expansion of the steam. Within a decade after
our first steam-operated railroad was opened, the lap-valve
became a recognized feature of the American
locomotive; but the cause of the saving of fuel, effected
by its use, was not well comprehended. Many enlightened
engineers attributed the saving to the early opening
of the exhaust, brought about where outside lap
was used, which they theorized reduced back pressure
on the piston; and in that way they accounted for the
enhanced economy resulting from the application of
lap. It was not till Colburn applied the indicator to
the locomotive, that the true cause of economy was
demonstrated to be in the additional work taken from
the steam by using it expansively.</p>

<h3>THE ALLEN VALVE.</h3>

<div id="i_8" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img src="images/i_p206.png" width="477" height="280" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span></div></div>

<p>An improvement on the plain <i>D</i> slide-valve has been
effected in a simple and ingenious manner in the Allen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>206</span>
valve, which is receiving considerable favor for high-speed
locomotives. This valve is shown in <a href="#i_8">Fig. 8</a>. The
valve has a supplementary steam-passage, <i>A</i>, <i>A</i>, cast
above the exhaust cavity. The valve and seat are so
arranged, that, so soon as the outside edge of the valve
begins to uncover the steam-port at <i>B</i>, the supplementary
passage begins receiving steam at <i>C</i>; and this gives
a double opening for the admission of steam to the port
when the travel is short. As the travel of the valve is
always short when an engine is running at high speed,
the advantage of this double opening is very great; for
it has the effect of admitting the steam promptly at
the beginning of the stroke, and maintaining a full
pressure on the piston till the point of cut-off.</p>

<h3>ADVANTAGES OF THE ALLEN VALVE.</h3>

<p>With an ordinary valve cutting off at six inches, and
having five inches eccentric throw, the port opening<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>207</span>
seldom exceeds ⅜ inch. It is a hard matter getting the
full pressure of steam through such a small opening
in the instant given for admission. If an Allen valve
is used with that motion, the opening will be double,
making ¾ inch, which makes an important difference.
The practical effect of a change of this kind is that an
engine will take a train along, cutting off at six inches
with the Allen valve, when, with the ordinary valve, the
links would have to be dropped to eight or nine inches.
The valve can be designed to work on any valve-seat,
but the dimensions given in <a href="#i_8">Fig. 8</a> are those that have
been found most satisfactory with our large passenger
engines. In designing an Allen valve for an old seat,
it is sometimes advisable to widen the steam-ports a
quarter of an inch or more, by chamfering off the outside
edges that amount. Care must be taken to prevent
the valve from traveling so far as to put the
supplementary port over the exhaust-port, for that would
allow live steam to pass through. The proper dimensions
can best be schemed out on paper before making
the required change on the seat.</p>

<p>In very carefully conducted experiments made on
the Boston and Albany Railroad, to compare the performance
of the Allen valve with an engine equipped
with a common valve, it was found that the Allen
valve effected a fuel saving of seven per cent.</p>

<h3>CASE WHERE THE ALLEN VALVE PROVED ITS VALUE.</h3>

<p>On one of the leading railroads in this country, an
engineer was running a locomotive on a fast train where
it was a hard matter making the card-time. A few
minutes could be saved by passing a water-station; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>208</span>
this was done at serious risk, for the tender would
nearly always be empty by the time the next water-station
was reached. The master mechanic of the
road determined to equip this engine with the Allen
valve: and, after the change was made, there was no
risk in passing the water-station; for there always was
a good margin of water in the tank when the next
watering-place was reached. The engine seemed to
steam better, because the work was done with less
steam; and there was a decided saving of fuel. The
change made the engine smarter, and there seems to
be no limit to the speed it can make. This valve can
be applied to any locomotive with trifling expense.
When an engine is designed specially for the Allen
valve, the steam ports and bridges are usually made a
little wider than for the ordinary valve. The only real
difficulty in adopting the valve is getting the casting
properly made, so that the supplementary port will not
be too rough for the passage of steam, and the thin
shell will be strong enough to stand the pressure.</p>

<h3>INSIDE CLEARANCE.</h3>

<p>For high-speed locomotives, where there is great
necessity for getting rid of the exhaust steam quickly,
the valves are sometimes cut away at the edges of the
cavity, so that, when the valve is placed in the middle of
the seat, it does not entirely cover the inside of either
of the steam-ports. This is called inside clearance.
In many instances inside clearance has been adopted
in an effort to rectify mistakes made in designing
the valve-motion, principally to overcome defects caused
by deficiency of valve-travel. The fastest locomotives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>209</span>
throughout the country do not require inside clearance,
because their valve-motion is so designed that it is not
necessary. Inside clearance induces premature release,
and diminishes the period of expansion. Consequently
inside clearance wastes steam, and ought to be avoided.</p>

<h3>LEAD.</h3>

<p>There are certain advantages gained in the working
of a locomotive, by having the valves set so that the
steam-port will be open a small distance for admission
of steam, when the piston is at the beginning of the
stroke. This opening is called lead. On the steam
side of the valve the opening is called steam-lead: on
the exhaust side it is called exhaust-lead. Lead is generally
produced by advancing the eccentric on the shaft,
its effect being to accelerate every event of the valve’s
movement; viz., admission, cut-off, release, and compression.
In the most perfectly constructed engines,
there soon comes to be lost motion in the rod connections
and in the boxes. The effect of this lost motion
is to delay the movement of the valves; and, unless they
are set with a lead opening, the stroke of the piston
would in some instances be commenced before steam
got into the cylinder. It is also found in practice, that
this lost motion would cause a pounding at each change
in the direction of the piston’s travel, unless there is
the necessary cushion to bring the cranks smoothly
over the centers. Without cushion, the change of
direction of the piston’s travel is effected by a series
of jerks that are hard on the working-parts. So long
as the lead opening at the beginning of the stroke is
not advanced enough to produce injurious counter pressure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>210</span>
upon the piston, it improves the working of the
engine by causing a prompt opening for steam admission
at the beginning of the stroke. This is the time
that a full steam-pressure is wanted in the cylinder, if
economical working be a consideration. A judiciously
arranged lead opening is therefore an advantage; since
it increases the port opening at the proper time for
admitting steam, tending to give nearly boiler pressure
in the cylinder at the beginning of the stroke. With
the shifting link-motion, the amount of lead opening
increases as the links are hooked back towards the
center notch; the magnitude of the increase, in most
cases, being in direct proportion to the shortness of the
eccentric-rods. A common lead opening in full gear
with the shifting link is 1/16 inch, which often increases
to ⅜ inch in the center notch. The tendency of wear
and lost motion is to neutralize the lead, so that, when
a locomotive motion gets worn, increasing the lead will
generally improve the working of the engine.</p>

<h3>OPERATION OF THE STEAM IN THE CYLINDERS.</h3>

<p>As the work performed by a steam-engine is in direct
proportion to the pressure exerted by the steam on the
side of the piston which is pulling or pushing on
the crank-pin, it is important that the steam should
press only on one side of the piston at once. Hence,
good engines have the valves operated so that, by the
time a stroke is completed, the steam, which was pushing
the piston, shall escape, and not obstruct the piston
during the return stroke, and so neutralize the steam
pressing upon the other side. When an engine is working
properly, the steam is admitted alternately to each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>211</span>
side of the piston; and its work is done against a pressure
on the other side not much higher than that of the
atmosphere.</p>

<h3>BACK PRESSURE IN THE CYLINDERS.</h3>

<p>When, from any cause, the steam is not permitted to
escape promptly and freely from the cylinder at the end
of the piston stroke, a pressure higher than that of
the atmosphere remains in the cylinder, obstructing the
piston during the return stroke, and causing what is
known as back pressure. There is seldom trouble for
want of sufficient opening to admit steam to the cylinders,
for the pressure is so great that the steam rushes
in through a very limited space; but, when the steam
has expanded two or three times, its pressure is comparatively
weak, and needs a wide opening to get out in
the short time allowed. This is one reason why the
exhaust-port is made larger than the admission-ports.
Nearly all engines with short ports suffer more or less
from back pressure, but the most fruitful cause of loss
of power through this source is the use of extremely
contracted exhaust nozzles. Were it not for the necessity
of making a strong artificial draught in the smoke-stack,
so that an intense heat shall be created in the
fire-box, quite a saving of power, now lost by back pressure,
would be effected by having the exhaust opening as
large as the exhaust-pipe. This not being practicable
with locomotives, engineers should endeavor to have
their nozzles as large as possible consistent with steam-making.</p>

<p>Engines with very limited eccentric throw will often
cause back pressure when hooked up, through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>212</span>
valve not opening the port wide enough for free
exhaust.</p>

<p>Locomotives suffering from excessive back pressure
are nearly always logy. The engine can not be urged
into more than moderate speed under any circumstances;
and all work is done at the expense of lavish
waste of fuel, for a serious percentage of the steam-pressure
on the right side of the piston is lost by pressure
on the wrong side. It is like the useless labor a
man has to do turning a grindstone with one crank,
while a boy is holding back on the other side. The
weight of obstruction done by the boy must be subtracted
from the power exerted by the man to find the
net useful energy exerted in turning the grindstone.
In the same way, every pound of back pressure on a
piston takes away a pound of useful work done by the
steam on the other side.</p>

<h3>EFFECT OF TOO MUCH INSIDE LAP.</h3>

<p>Engines that have much inside lap to the valves are
likely to suffer from back pressure when high speed is
attempted. The inside lap delays the release of the
steam; and, where the piston’s velocity is high the
steam does not escape from the cylinder in time to
prevent back pressure.</p>

<h3>RUNNING INTO A HILL.</h3>

<p>Most of engineers are familiar with the tendency of
some engines to “run into a hill.” That is, so soon as
a hill is struck, they suddenly slow down till a certain
speed is reached, when they will keep going. This is
generally produced by back pressure, its obstructing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>213</span>
effect being reduced when the engine is moving
slow.</p>

<h3>COMPRESSION.</h3>

<p>The necessity which requires lap to be put on a slide-valve
to produce an early cut-off, in its turn causes compression,
by the valve passing over the steam-port, and
closing it entirely for a limited period towards the end
of the return stroke. As the cylinder contains some
steam which did not pass out while the exhaust-port
was open, this is now squeezed into a diminishing space
by the advancing piston. In cases where too much
steam was left in the cylinders through contracted
nozzles or other causes, or where, through mistaken
designing of the valve-motion, the port is closed during
a protracted period, the steam in the cylinder gets compressed
above boiler tension, and loss of useful effect is
the result. Under proper limits, the closing of the port
before the end of the stroke, and the consequent compression
of the steam remaining in the cylinder, have a
useful effect on the working of the engine by providing
an elastic cushion, which absorbs the momentum of the
piston and its connections, leading the crank smoothly
over the center. Where it can be so arranged, the
amount of compression desirable for any engine is the
degree that, along with the lead, will raise the pressure
of the cylinder up to that of the boiler at the beginning
of the stroke. When this can be regulated, the compression
performs desirable service by cushioning the
working-parts, thereby preventing pounding, and by
filling up the clearance space and steam passages, by
that means saving live steam. Compression probably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>214</span>
does some economical service by reheating the cylinder,
which has a tendency to get cooled down during the
period of release, and by re-evaporating the water,
which forms by condensation of steam in the cool cylinder.</p>

<p>Engines that are running fast require more cushioning
than those that run slow, or at moderate speeds.
The link-motion, by its peculiarity of hastening compression
when the links are hooked up, tends to make
compression a useful service in fast running.</p>

<h3>DEFINITION OF AN ECCENTRIC.</h3>

<p>The reciprocating motion which causes the valves to
open and close the steam-ports at the proper periods, is,
with most locomotives, imparted from eccentrics fastened
upon the driving-axle. An eccentric is a circular
plate, or disk, which is secured to the axle in such a
position that it will turn round on an axis which is not
in the center of the disk. The distance from the center
of the disk to the point round which it revolves is
called its eccentricity, and is half the throw of the eccentric.
Thus, if the throw of an eccentric requires to
be 5 inches, the distance between the center of the
driving-axle and the center of the eccentric will be 2½
inches. The movement of an eccentric is the same as
that of a crank of the same stroke, and the eccentric is
preferred merely because it is more convenient for the
purposes to which it is applied than a crank would be.</p>

<h3>EARLY APPLICATION OF THE ECCENTRIC.</h3>

<p>On the early forms of locomotives, a single eccentric
was used to operate the valve for forward and back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>215</span>
motion. The eccentric was made with a half circular
slot, on which it could be turned to the position needed
for forward or back motion. It was held in the required
position by a stop-stud fastened on the axle. Several
forms of movable eccentrics were invented, and received
considerable application during the first decade of railroad
operating; but the best of them provided an extremely
defective reversing motion. The first engineer
to apply two fixed eccentrics as a reversible gear was
William T. James of New York, who made a steam
carriage in 1829, and worked the engine with four
eccentrics,—two for each side. The eccentrics were
connected with a link, but the merits of that form of
connection were not then recognized here; for it was
not applied to locomotives till it became popular in
England, and was re-introduced to this country by
Rogers. The advantage of the double fixed eccentrics
seemed, however, to be recognized from the time James
used them; for the plan was adopted by our first locomotive
builders. The first locomotive built by Long,
who started in 1833 what was afterwards known as the
Norris Locomotive Works, Philadelphia, had four fixed
eccentrics.</p>

<h3>RELATIVE MOTION OF PISTON AND CRANK, SLIDE-VALVE, AND
ECCENTRICS.</h3>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.</span></div></div>

<p>When a locomotive is running, the wheels turn with
something near a uniform speed; but any part which
receives a reciprocating motion from a crank or eccentric
travels at an irregular velocity. <a href="#i_9">Fig. 9</a> shows the
relative motion of the crank-pin and piston during a
half revolution. The points in the path of the crank-pin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>216</span>
marked <i>A</i>, 1, 2, <i>B</i>, 3, 4, <i>C</i>, are at equal distances
apart. The vertical lines run from them to the points
<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, represent the position of the piston in relation
to the position of the crank-pin. That is, while the
crank-pin traverses the half-circle, <i>A B C</i>, to make a
half revolution, the piston, guided by the cross-head,
travels a distance within the cylinder equal to the
straight line <i>A C</i>. The crank-pin travels at nearly uniform
speed during the whole of its revolution, but the
piston travels with an irregular motion. Thus, while
the crank-pin travels from <i>A</i> to 1, the piston travels a
distance equal to the space between <i>A</i> and <i>a</i>. By the
space between the lines, it will be seen that the piston
travels slowly at the beginning of the stroke, gets faster
as it moves along, reaches its highest velocity about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>217</span>
half stroke, then slows down towards the end till it
stops, and is ready for the return stroke.</p>

<h3>ATTEMPTS TO ABOLISH THE CRANK.</h3>

<p>Certain mechanics and inventors have been terribly
harassed over this irregular motion of the piston, and
numerous devices have been produced for the purpose
of securing a uniform motion to the power transmitted.
These inventions have usually taken the shape of rotary
engines. Probably the fault these people find with the
reciprocating engine is one of its greatest merits, for
the piston stopping at the end of each stroke permits
an element of time for the steam to get in and out of
the cylinder.</p>

<h3>VALVE MOVEMENT.</h3>

<p>The valve travels in a manner similar to the piston;
although its stroke is much shorter, and its slow movement
is towards the limit of travel. The small circle in
the figure shows the orbit of the eccentric’s center, and
the valve-travel is equal to the rectilinear line across the
circle. If the valve opened the steam-ports at the outside
of its travel, the slow movement at that point would
be an objection, since the operation of opening would
be slow: but the valve opens the ports towards the middle
of its travel, when its velocity is greatest; and, the
nearer to the mid travel the act of opening is done, the
more promptly it will be performed. This has a good
deal to do with making an engine “smart” in getting
away from a station.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>218</span></p>

<h3>EFFECT OF LAP ON THE ECCENTRIC’S POSITION.</h3>

<div id="i_10" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img src="images/i_p219.png" width="390" height="322" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span></div></div>

<p>With the short valve without lap used on the earliest
forms of locomotives, the eccentric was set at right
angles to the crank or “square” on the dotted line <i>e</i>,
<a href="#i_10">Fig. 10</a>. The least movement of the eccentric from its
middle position had the effect of opening the steam-ports.
One advantage about an eccentric set in this
position, was that it opened and closed the ports when
moving the valve at its greatest velocity. Lengthening
the valve-face by providing lap entails a change in the
location of the eccentric; for, were it left in the right-angle
position, the steam-port would remain covered
till the eccentric had moved the valve a distance equal
to the extent of the lap on one end, and the piston
would begin its stroke without steam.</p>

<h3>ANGULAR ADVANCE OF ECCENTRICS.</h3>

<p>The change made on the eccentric location is to advance
it from <i>e</i> to <i>F</i>, being a horizontal distance equal
to the extent of lap and lead, and known as the angular
advance of the eccentric. The centers <i>F</i> and <i>B</i> represent
the full part, or “belly,” of the forward and back
eccentrics in the position they should occupy, where a
rocker is employed, when the piston is at the beginning
of the backward stroke. It will be perceived that the
eccentrics both incline towards the crank-pin, and the
eccentric which is controlling the valve follows the crank-pin.
Thus, when the engine is running forward, <i>F</i> follows
the crank: when she is backing, <i>B</i> follows.</p>

<p>It is a good plan for an engineer to make himself
familiar with the proper position of the eccentrics in
relation to the crank, for the knowledge is likely to save<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>219</span>
time and trouble when any thing goes wrong with the
valve-motion. With this knowledge properly digested,
a minute’s inspection is always sufficient to decide
whether or not any thing is wrong with the eccentrics.</p>

<h3>ANGULARITY OF CONNECTING ROD.</h3>

<p>In following out the relative motion of the piston and
crank, we discover a disturbing factor in what is called
the angularity of the connecting rod, which has a curiously
distorting effect on the harmony of the motion.
When the piston stands exactly in the mid-travel point,
the true length of the main rod will be measured from
the center of the wrist-pin to the center of the driving-axle.
If a tram of this length be extended between
these points, this will be found correct, as every machinist
accustomed to working on rods knows. Now,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>220</span>
if the back end of the tram should be raised or lowered
towards the points where the center of the crank-pin
must be when the crank stands on the top or bottom
quarter, it will be found that the tram point will not
reach the crank-pin center, but will fall short a distance
in proportion to the length of the main rod. The
dotted lines <i>a′</i> and <i>b′</i> in <a href="#i_11">Fig. 11</a> show how far a rod 7½
times the length of the crank falls short. A shorter rod
will magnify this obliquity, while a longer rod will reduce
it.</p>

<div id="i_11" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 19em;">
  <img src="images/i_p220.png" width="304" height="79" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span></div></div>

<h3>EFFECT ON THE VALVE-MOTION OF CONNECTING-ROD
ANGULARITY.</h3>

<p>As the opening and closing of the steam-ports by the
valves are regulated by the eccentrics, which are subject
to the same motion as the crank, following it at an
unvarying distance, it is evident that their tendency will
be to admit and cut off steam at a certain position of
the crank’s movement. If the motion is planned to cut
off at half stroke, it will be apparent, that, in the backward
stroke, the piston will be past its mid travel before
the crank-pin reaches the quarter, so that end of the
cylinder will receive steam during more than half the
stroke. On the forward stroke of the piston, however,
the crank-pin will reach the quarter before the piston
has attained half travel; the consequence being, that in
this case steam is cut off too early. The disturbing effect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>221</span>
of the angularity of the connecting rod on the steam
distribution thus tends to make the cut-off later in the
backward stroke than in the forward stroke, resulting in
giving the forward end of the cylinder more steam than
what is admitted in the back end. The link-motion
provides a convenient means of correcting the inequality
of valve opening due to the connecting-rod angularity,
the details of which will be explained farther on.</p>

<h3>AIDS TO THE STUDY OF VALVE-MOTION.</h3>

<p>An engineer or machinist who wishes to study out
this peculiarity of connecting-rod angularity, will find
that the use of a tram or long dividers will help him to
comprehend it better than any letter-type description.
All through the study of the valve-motion, there are
numerous difficult problems encountered. The use of a
good model will be found an invaluable aid to the study
of the valve-motion, and every division of engineers or
firemen should make a combined effort to furnish their
meeting-room with a model of a locomotive valve-motion.
In no way can the spare time of the men connected
with locomotive running be better employed
than in the wide range for study presented by a well-devised
model. Great aid can be obtained in the study
of the valve-motion from good books devoted to the
subject, and they will impart more information than can
be obtained by mere contact with the locomotive. The
valve and its movements are surrounded with so many
complicated influences, that an intelligent man may
work for years about a locomotive doing valve setting
occasionally, and other gang boss work, yet, unless he
studies the valve-motion by the aid of the drawing-board,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>222</span>
or by models, which admit of changing sizes and
dimensions, he may know less about the cause of certain
movements than the bright lad who has been a couple
of years in the drawing-office. The man who thinks he
can study the valve-motion, and understand its philosophy,
by merely running the engine, deceives himself.
The engineer who never looks at a book or a paper in
search of information about his engine, knows very little
about any thing not visible to the eye. Yet many men
of this stamp, by looking wise, and by exercising a
judicious use of silence, pass among their fellows as
remarkably profound. But let a fireman, in quest of
locomotive knowledge, put a question to such a man,
and he is immediately silenced with a “You ought to
know better” answer.</p>

<p>Where the use of a model can not be obtained, any
one beginning the study of the valve-motion can assist
himself by making a cross section of the valve and its
seat, similar to those published, on a strip of thin wood
or thick paper. By slipping the valve on the seat, its
position at different parts of the stroke can be comprehended
more clearly than by a mere description. With
a pair of dividers to represent the motion of the eccentric,
and strips of wood to act as eccentric, and valve
rod and rocker, and some tacks to fasten them together,
a helpful model can be improvised on a table or board.
By the time a student gets a rig of this kind going, he
will see his way to contrive other methods of self-help.</p>

<h3>EVENTS OF THE PISTON STROKE.</h3>

<p>By the aid of <a href="#i_10">Fig. 10</a>, we will trace the relative movements
of the crank and eccentric connections. For the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>223</span>
sake of simplicity, the eccentric is represented as connecting
directly with the rocker-arm.</p>

<p>The crank-pin being at the point <i>A</i>, or the forward
center, the piston must be in the front of the cylinder,
or at the beginning of the backward stroke. Owing to
the angular advance already referred to, the eccentric
center is at <i>F</i>; and, being a certain distance ahead of
the middle position, it has pushed the lower arm of the
rocker from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>, drawing back the top arm, which,
in its turn, has moved the valve so that it is just beginning
to admit steam at the forward port, <i>i</i>. As the
crank-pin goes round, the eccentric follows it, opening
the steam-port wider till the eccentric reaches the point
of its travel nearest <i>A</i>, the limit of the throw. When
the eccentric is at this point of its throw, the valve
must be at the outside of its travel; and therefore the
steam-port is wide open. By this time the crank-pin is
getting close up towards the quarter. After passing
this point, the forward eccentric begins to draw the
bottom rocker-pin towards the axle, and to push the
valve ahead, this being the point where the valve
changes its direction of motion, just as the piston returns
when the crank-pin passes the center. When <i>F</i>
reaches the point <i>B</i>, the valve is in the same position it
occupied at the beginning of the stroke; but, as it is
traveling in the opposite direction, a very small movement
more closes the port, cutting off steam. When
this happens, the crank-pin has reached the point <i>x</i>.
When <i>F</i> gets to <i>g</i>, it is on the central point of its throw;
so the valve must then be on the middle point of its
travel, with the exhaust cavity just covering the outside
edges of the bridges, the forward edge being ready<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>224</span>
to put the steam-port, <i>i</i>, in communication with the exhaust
cavity. This releases the steam from the forward
end of the cylinder; and at the same moment the inside
edge of the valve covers the back port, <i>k</i>, causing the
piston-head to compress any steam left in the back part
of the cylinder. When the piston reaches the beginning
of the forward stroke, the eccentric <i>F</i> has got to
the point <i>f</i>, and the valve is beginning to admit steam
for the return stroke, the events of which are similar to
those described.</p>

<p>In actual practice, the steam distribution is a little
different from the manner that has been followed; for the
link-motion provides the means of equalizing the cut-off,
making it uniform for both strokes. This changes
the events of the stroke a little; but the student who
engraves in his mind the movements as they are represented
in the diagram, will not be far astray.</p>

<h3>WHAT HAPPENS INSIDE THE CYLINDERS WHEN AN ENGINE IS
REVERSED.</h3>

<p>Many men who have a fair understanding of the action
of steam in an engine’s cylinders during ordinary
working, have no idea of the operations performed in the
cylinders when a locomotive is running in reverse motion.
All men who have had any thing to do with train
service, know, that, when an engine is reversed, the action
works to stop the train, even if the locomotive should
have no steam on the boiler; but just in what way this
result comes round they can not clearly perceive. In
hopes of throwing light upon this subject for those who
have not studied it out, we will follow the events of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>225</span>
stroke in reversed motion, as we did in the ordinary
working.</p>

<h3>EVENTS OF THE STROKE IN REVERSED MOTION.</h3>

<p>Supposing an engine to be running ahead, and the
necessity arises for stopping suddenly, and the reverse-lever
is pulled into the back notch. When the crank-pin
is on the forward center, and therefore the piston
at the forward end of the cylinder, about to begin its
backward stroke, the valve has the forward port open
a distance equal to the amount of lead, as in <a href="#i_10">Fig. 10</a>.
But, as the back-up eccentric has control of the valve,
the latter is being pushed forward; and it closes the
forward port just as the piston begins to move back.
This shuts off all communication with the forward end
of the cylinder; and the receding piston creates a vacuum
behind it, just as a pump-plunger does under similar
circumstances. At this time the back end of the cylinder
is open to the exhaust, and the piston pushes out
the air freely to the atmosphere. By the time the piston
travels about two inches, the valve gets to its middle
position; and, immediately after passing that point, it
opens the forward end of the cylinder to the exhaust,
and closes the back port. When this event happens,
the vacuum in the forward end of the cylinder gets
filled with hot gases, that rush in from the smoke-box;
and the receding piston keeps drawing air into the
cylinder in this way during the remainder of the stroke,
and air from that quarter seldom gets in without bringing
a sprinkling of cinders. The back steam-port is
closed only during about two inches of the stroke,
while the lap of the valve is traveling over it. About<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>226</span>
the time the piston reaches four inches of its travel,
the back steam-port is open to the steam-chest, and the
piston forces the air through the steam-pipes into the
boiler during the remainder of the stroke. The forward
stroke is merely a repetition of the backward
stroke described.</p>

<p>When it is necessary to reverse a locomotive, it is a
better plan to hook the lever clear back than to have it
a notch or two past the center, as some men persist in
doing, under the mistaken belief that they are in some
way saving their engine from harsh usage. When the
link is reversed full, the cylinders are merely turned
into air-pumps. When the links are put near the center,
the travel of the valve is reduced; and the periods
when the piston is creating a vacuum in one end of the
cylinder, and compressing the air in the other, are prolonged.
The result is, that, when the exhaust is opened
in the first case, the gases rush in violently from the
smoke-box, carrying a heavy load of cinders: in the
other case, the piston compresses the air in the cylinder
so high that it jerks the valve away from its seat in
trying to find outlet. This causes the clattering noise
in the steam-chest, so well known in cases where engines
are run without steam while the reverse-lever is near
the center.</p>

<p>A locomotive with the piston-packing in bad order
will not hold well running in reverse-motion. Some
kinds of piston-packing do not seem to act properly
when the engine is reversed, especially at low speed.
Where a valve has much inside lap, there will be a
vacuum in one end of the cylinder, and compressed air
in the other end. With piston packing that requires<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>227</span>
pressure to expand it, the void at one end of the cylinder
may neutralize the pressure at the other by drawing
the air through the piston. This would be most
liable to happen where the lever was kept near the
center.</p>

<h3>PURPOSE OF RELIEF-VALVE ON DRY PIPE.</h3>

<p>Should the throttle-valve close so tight that the compressed
air from the cylinders can not pass into the
boiler, there is danger of bursting the steam-chest or
some part of the steam-pipes. The compressed air will
lift most of the throttle-valves far enough to prevent
any great danger from this source. In some engines a
relief-valve is secured in the dry pipe, which provides
a passage for this compressed air. When the cylinder-cocks
of an engine are opened when the motion is reversed,
they form an outlet to the compressed air, and
also admit air to the sucking end without letting the
piston draw air so freely through the nozzles. Many
cylinder-cocks are now made so that they will open
automatically to permit the piston to draw air through
them. The reversed engine will stop nearly as well
with the cylinder-cocks opened as when they are closed,
and it is much more easily handled with the cocks
opened. Where the cocks are kept closed, the rush of
hot air from the smoke-box laps every trace of oil from
the valve-seat, and a heavy pressure—frequently above
that of the boiler—is present in the steam-chest.
When the engine stops under these circumstances, its
tendency is to fly back; and an engineer has some difficulty
in controlling it with the reverse-lever till a few
turns empty the chest and pipes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>228</span></p>

<h3>USING REVERSE-MOTION AS A BRAKE.</h3>

<p>Numerous attempts have been made to utilize the
reversed engine as a brake for stopping the train, and
even by this means to save some of the power lost in
stopping. Chatelier, a French engineer, experimented
for many years on this mechanical problem. He injected
a jet of water into the exhaust-pipe, which supplied
low-tension steam to the cylinder, instead of hot
gas or air coming through the smoke-box. This was
pumped back into the boiler on the return stroke.
Thus the act of stopping a train was used to compress
a quantity of steam, converting the work of stopping
into heat, which was forced into the boiler and retained
to aid in getting the train into speed again. Modifications
of this idea produce the car-starters that pass so
frequently through our Patent Office.</p>

<p>As a means of conserving mechanical energy, the
Chatelier brake was not a success; but, in the absence
of better power brakes, it met with some applications in
Europe. Some of our mountain railroads use it, under
the name of the water-brake, as an auxiliary to the
automatic brake.</p>

</div>

<h3>EARLY REVERSING MOTIONS.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">In</span> the engineering practice of the world, before the
locomotive and marine engines came into use, there
was no need for devices to make engines rotate in more
than one direction. When the need for a reversible
engine first arose, it was met by very crude appliances.
Locomotives were kept at work, earning money for
their owners, which were reversed by the man in charge
stopping the engine, and by means of a wrench changing
the position of the eccentric by hand. A decided
improvement on the wrench was the movable eccentric,
which was held in forward or back gear by stops; the
operation of reversing being done by a treadle or other
attachment located near the engineer’s position. A
serious objection to this form of reversing gear was,
that the abrasion of work enlarged the slot ends, and
wore out the stops, leading to inaccuracy and frequent
breakage. A somewhat better form of reversing motion
was a fixed eccentric, with the means at the end of the
eccentric-rod for engaging with the top or bottom of a
rocker-shaft, which operated the valve-stem. This was
the form of reversing motion used on the early Baldwin
engines. Numerous other appliances, more or less defective,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>230</span>
were experimented with before the double fixed
eccentrics were introduced. Till the link was applied
to valve-motion, the double eccentrics—an American
invention—were the most important improvement that
had been made on the locomotive valve-motion since
the incipiency of the engine. The <span class="sans bold">V</span> hook, in connection
with the double eccentrics, made a fair reversing
motion in comparison to any thing that had preceded
it. The objection to the hook was, that, when the
necessity arose for reversing the engine while in
motion, much difficulty was experienced in getting
the hook to catch the pin. As a simple, prompt, and
certain reversing motion, the link was readily acknowledged
to be far superior to any thing that had previously
been tried.</p>

<h3>INVENTION OF THE LINK.</h3>

<p>There is no doubt but the link was first applied to
a steam engine by William T. James of New York, a
most ingenious mechanic, who also invented the double
eccentrics. James experimented a great deal about the
period from 1830 to 1840, with steam carriages for
common roads; and it was in this connection that he
invented the link. His work having proved a commercial
failure, the improvements on the valve-motion were
not recognized at the time; although the probability is,
that Long, who started the Norris Locomotive Works
of Philadelphia, and brought out the double eccentrics
upon the locomotives built there, was indebted to James
for the idea of a separate eccentric for each direction
of engine movement.</p>

<p>The credit of inventing the ordinary shifting link is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>231</span>
due to William Howe of Newcastle, England. This
inventor was a pattern-maker in the works of Robert
Stephenson &amp; Co., and he invented the link in 1842 in
practically its present form. The idea of Howe was to
get out an improved reversing motion; and he made a
pencil-sketch of the link, to explain his views to his
employers. The superintendent of the works was
favorably disposed to the invention, and ordered Howe
to make a pattern of the motion, which was done; and
this was submitted to Stephenson, who approved of the
link, and directed that one should be tried on a locomotive.
Although Stephenson gave Howe the means of
applying his invention, he does not seem to have perceived
its actual value, for the link was not patented;
and Stephenson never failed to patent any device which
he thought worth protecting.</p>

<p>The link-motion was applied to a locomotive constructed
for the Midland Railway Company, and proved
a success from the day it was put on. Seeing how
satisfactorily the invention worked, Robert Stephenson
paid Howe twenty guineas (one hundred and five
dollars) for the device, and adopted the link as the
valve-gear for his locomotives. This is how the shifting
link comes to be called the “Stephenson link,” and the
credit for this invention was not extravagantly paid for.</p>

<p>The capability which the link possesses of varying
the steam admission and release, did not appear to be
understood by the inventor; nor was the mechanical
world aware, for some time after the link was brought
into use, that it could be employed to adjust the inequality
of steam distribution, due to the angularity
of the connecting rod.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>232</span></p>

<h3>CONSTRUCTION OF THE SHIFTING LINK.</h3>

<div id="i_12" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 72em;">
  <img src="images/i_p232.png" width="1149" height="568" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span></div></div>

<p>As usually constructed for American locomotives, the
link is a slotted block curved to the arc of a circle, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>233</span>
a radius about equal to the distance between the center
of the driving-axle and the center of the rocker-pin.
The general plan of the link-motion is shown in <a href="#i_12">Fig. 12</a>.
Fitted to slide in the link-slot is the block which
encircles the rocker-pin. The eccentric-rods are pinned
to the back of the link; the forward eccentric-rod connecting
with the top, and the back-up eccentric-rod
with the bottom, of the link. Bolted to the side and
near the middle of the link is the saddle, which holds
the stud to which the hanger is attached; this, in its
turn, connecting with the lifting arm, which is operated
by the reversing rod that enables the engineer to place
the link in any desired position.</p>

<h3>ACTION OF THE LINK.</h3>

<p>Regarded in its simplest form, the action of the link
in full gear is the same upon the valve movement as
a single eccentric. When the motion is working, as in
the figure, with the eccentric-rod pin in line with the
rocker-pin, it will be perceived that the movement can
not differ much from what it would be were the eccentric-rod
attached to the rocker. Here the forward
eccentric appears as controlling the movement of the
valve. Putting the link in back motion brings the end
of the backing eccentric-rod opposite the rocker-pin,
the effect being that the back-up eccentric then operates
the valve. When the link-block is shifted toward
the center of the link, the horizontal travel of the
rocker-pin is decreased; consequently, the travel of
the valve is reduced; for, with ordinary engines, the
travel of the valve in full gear equals the throw of the
eccentrics, the top and bottom rocker-arm being of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>234</span>
the same length. The motion transmitted from the
eccentrics, and their means of connection with the link,
make the latter swing as if it were pivoted on a center
which had a horizontal movement equal to the lap and
lead of the valve. The extremities of the link, or
rather the points opposite the eccentric-rods, swing a
distance equal to the full throw of the eccentric. The
variation of valve-travel that can be effected by the
link, is from that of the eccentric throw in full gear
down to a distance in mid gear which agrees with the
extent of lap and lead. The method of obtaining these
various degrees of travel is by moving the link so that
the block which encircles the rocker-pin shall approach
the middle of the link.</p>

<p>When an engine is run with the lever in the center
notch, the supply of steam is admitted by the lead-opening
alone. In full gear the eccentric, whose rod-end
is in line with the rocker-pin, exerts almost exclusive
control over the valve movement; but, as the link-block
gets hooked towards the center, it comes to some extent
under the influence of both eccentrics.</p>

<p>A thoughtful examination of <a href="#i_12">Fig. 12</a> will throw light
on the reason why the proper position of a slipped
eccentric can be determined by the other eccentric
when the engine is on the center. In the cut, the
crank-pin is represented on the forward center; and in
that position the eccentric centers are both an equal
distance in advance of the main shaft center. It will
be evident now that the valve must occupy practically
the same position for forward or back gear, as each of
the eccentric-rods reaches the same distance forward.
Putting the motion in back gear would bring the backup<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>235</span>
eccentric-rod pin to the position now occupied by
the pin belonging to the forward eccentric-rod.</p>

<h3>VALVE-MOTION OF A FAST PASSENGER LOCOMOTIVE.</h3>

<p>Reducing the travel of the valve by drawing the
reverse-lever towards the center of the quadrant, and
consequently the link-block towards the middle of the
link-slot, not only hastens the steam cut-off, but it accelerates
in a like degree every other event of steam distribution
throughout the stroke. To explain this point,
let us take the motion of a well-designed engine in
actual service, which has done good economical work
on fast train running. The valve-travel is five inches,
lap one inch, no inside lap, lead in full gear 1/16 inch,
point of suspension 9/16 inch back of center of link.</p>

<h3>EFFECT OF CHANGING VALVE-TRAVEL.</h3>

<p>When this engine is working in full gear, the steam
will be freely admitted behind the piston till about
eighteen inches of the stroke, when cut-off takes place;
and the release or exhaust opening will begin at about
twenty-two inches of the stroke, giving four inches for
expansion of steam. Now, if the links of this engine
are hooked up so that the cut-off takes place at six
inches of the stroke, the steam will be released at
sixteen inches of the stroke; and at that point compression
will begin at the other end of the cylinder.</p>

<h3>WEAK POINTS OF THE LINK-MOTION.</h3>

<p>This attribute which the link-motion possesses, of
accelerating the release and compression along with the
cut-off, is very detrimental to the economical operating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>236</span>
of locomotives that run slow. High-speed engines need
the pre-release to give time for the escape of the steam
before the beginning of the return stroke; and the compression
is economically utilized in receiving the heavy
blow from the fast-moving, reciprocating parts, whose
direction of motion has to be suddenly changed at the
end of each stroke, and in helping to raise the pressure
promptly in the cylinder at the beginning of the stroke.
A locomotive, on the other hand, that does most of its
work with a low-piston speed, would not suffer from
back pressure if the steam were permitted to follow
the piston close to the end of the stroke; and a very
short period of compression would suffice. If the
engine, whose motion we have been considering, instead
of releasing at sixteen inches, could allow the steam to
follow the piston to twenty-two inches of the stroke,
after cutting off at six inches, a very substantial gain
of power would ensue. And this would be well supplemented
by avoiding loss of power, did compression not
begin till within two inches of the return stroke.</p>

<h3>WHY DECREASING THE VALVE-TRAVEL INCREASES THE PERIOD
OF EXPANSION.</h3>

<p>Increase of expansion follows reduced valve-travel,
from a similar cause to that which produces expansion
when lap is added to the edge of a slide-valve. When
the valve is made with the face merely long enough to
cover the steam-ports, there can be no expansion of the
steam; for, so soon as the valve ceases to admit steam,
it opens the steam-port to the exhaust. When lap is
added, however, the steam is inclosed in the cylinder,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>237</span>
without egress for the time that it takes the lap to
travel over the steam-port. An arrangement of motion
which will make the valve travel quickly over the port,
has a tendency to shorten the period for expansion;
while making the valve travel slowly over the port, has
the opposite effect, and protracts expansion. A valve
with, say, five inches travel, has a comparatively long
journey to make during the stroke of the piston; and
the lap-edges will pass quickly over the steam-ports,—much
more quickly than they will when the travel is
reduced to three inches. In a case of this kind, there
is more than the mere reduction of travel to be considered.
Suppose the valve has one inch lap at each
end. When it stands on the middle of the seat, it has
a reciprocating motion of two and one-half inches at
each side of that point to make. At the beginning of
the stroke, it has been drawn aside one inch (we will
ignore the lead), but still has one and one-half inch to
travel before it begins to return. On the other hand,
when the travel is reduced to three inches, the valve
has only one and one-half inch to travel away from the
center; and, one inch being moved to draw the lap over
the port, there only remains one-half inch for the valve
to move before it must begin returning. This entails
an early cut-off; for the valve must pass over the ports
with its slow motion, and be ready to open the port on
the other end, before the return stroke. Thus a travel
of five inches draws the outside edge of the valve one
and one-half inch away from the outside of the steam-ports,
three inches travel only draws it one-half inch
away, and a greater reduction of travel decreases the
opening in like proportion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>238</span></p>

<h3>INFLUENCE OF ECCENTRIC THROW ON THE VALVE.</h3>

<p>As reducing the travel of the valve diminishes the
port opening, a point is reached in cutting off early in
the stroke where the port opening is hardly any more
than the port opening due to the lead. This is what
makes long steam-ports essential for a successful high-speed
locomotive. The best-designed engines give an
exceedingly limited port opening at short cut-offs, and
badly planned motion sometimes seriously detracts from
the efficiency of the engine, by curtailing the opening
at the point where a very brief time is given for the
admission of steam. The magnitude of the eccentric
throw exerts a direct influence on the port opening
when cutting off early. A long throw tends to increase
the opening, while a short throw reduces it. The
long-throw eccentric will draw the valve farther away
from the edge of the steam-port, when admitting steam
for the same point of cut-off, than a short-throw eccentric
will move its valve. For an ordinary 17 × 24 inch
locomotive, the throw of eccentric should not be less
than five inches, unless the engine is intended entirely
for slow running. There are many engines running
with eccentric throw less than five inches, but they are
invariably slow unless the valve-lap is very short. With
an ordinary lap, an engine having an eccentric throw
of 4½ inches needs so much angular advance to overcome
the lap, and provide lead, that the rectilineal
motion of the eccentric is very meager at the beginning
of the stroke. That is, the center of the eccentric is
traveling downward in its circular path, which gives
little motion to the valve, just as the crank gives decreased
motion to the cross-head when near the centers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>239</span></p>

<h3>HARMONY OF WORKING-PARTS.</h3>

<p>Hitherto we have regarded the link as merely performing
the functions of transmitting the motion of
the eccentrics to the valves, with the additional capability
of reducing the travel at the will of the engineer.
Otherwise, the motion of the link is intensely complex;
and its movements are susceptible to a multitude of
influences, which improve or disturb its action on the
valve. A good valve-motion is planned according to
certain dimensions of all the working-parts; and any
change in their arrangement will almost invariably
entail irregularities upon the link’s movement, which
will radically affect the distribution of steam. A link-motion
schemed for an eccentric throw of 4½ inches
will not work properly if the throw be increased to five
inches: a link with a radius of 57 inches can not be
changed with impunity for one of 60 inches. Any
change in the position of the tumbling-shaft or rocker-arms
distorts the whole motion, and any alteration in
the length of the rods or hangers has a similar effect.
That the link may perform its functions properly, all its
connections must remain in harmony.</p>

<h3>ADJUSTMENT OF LINK.</h3>

<p>A very important feature of the link is its property
of adjustability, which serves to neutralize the distorting
effect of the connecting rod’s angularity. As has
already been explained, the angularity of the main rod
tends to delay the cut-off during the backward stroke,
while it is accelerated in the forward stroke. With the
ordinary length of connections, this irregularity would
seriously affect the working of the engine. But it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>240</span>
almost entirely overcome by the link, which can be
suspended in a way that will produce equality for the
period of admission and point of cut-off for both strokes
in one gear. Perfect equalization of admission and cut-off
for both gears has been found impossible with the
link-motion; and designers are generally satisfied to
adjust the forward motion, and permit the back motion
to remain untrue. The point about the link which
exercises the most potent influence on adjusting the
cut-off, is the position of the saddle, or of its stud for
connecting the hanger. This stud is called the point of
suspension. Raising the saddle away from the center
of the link will effect adjustment of steam admission;
but in locomotive practice the saddle is nearly always
located in the middle of the link, there being practical
objections against raising it. Equalization of steam
distribution is produced by placing the hanger-stud or
point of suspension some distance back of the center
line of the link-slot, the distance varying from ⅛ inch
to ⅞ inch.</p>

<p>Moving the hanger-stud affects the link’s movement
in a way that is equivalent to temporarily lengthening
the eccentric-rod during a portion of the piston-stroke.
The length of the tumbling-shaft arms, the length of
hanger, the location of the rockers and tumbling-shaft,
the radius of link, and length of rods, all exercise
influence on the accurate adjustment of the valve-motion.</p>

<h3>SLIP OF THE LINK.</h3>

<p>In equalizing the valve-motion, and overcoming the
discrepancy of steam admission, due to the angularity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>241</span>
of the connecting rod by moving the link-hanger stud
away from the center of the slot, a new distortion is
introduced. The link-block being securely fastened to
the bottom of the rocker-pin, moves in the fixed arc
traversed by that pin, which is nearly horizontal. The
action of the eccentric-rods on the link, on the other
hand, forces the latter to move with a sort of vertical
motion at certain parts of the stroke, making it slip on
the block. Moving the hanger-stud back tends to increase
this slip, which will become excessive enough
to seriously impair the efficiency of the motion if not
kept within bounds by the designer. Where the slip
is very great, the motion will not be serviceable, a consideration
which can never be overlooked; for the block
will wear rapidly, producing lost motion, a very undesirable
defect about any part of a link-gear. With the
long rods which prevail in locomotive practice, designers
have no difficulty in keeping the slip within practical
bounds; but with marine engines it is sometimes necessary
to sacrifice equality of steam admission to the
reduction of the slip. The greatest amount of slip is
in full gear, and it diminishes as the link-block is moved
towards the center.</p>

<p>Placing the eccentric-rod pins back of the link-arc,
as is almost universally done in this country, has a
tendency to make the link slip on the block; and care
has to be taken not to locate these pins farther back
than is actually necessary for other requirements of the
link-motion’s adjustment. Auchincloss, who is a recognized
authority for designing of link-motion, gives four
varieties of alterations capable of reducing the slip
when it is found too great for a practicable motion.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>242</span>
His resorts are, either to increase the angular advance,
reduce the travel, increase the length of link, or shorten
the eccentric-rods. One, or a combination, of these
methods may be adopted, as the designer finds most
convenient.</p>

<h3>RADIUS OF LINK.</h3>

<p>Among the constructing engineers who plan link-motion,
there is considerable diversity of opinion about
what radius of link helps to produce the best valve-motion.
The distance between the center of axle and
center of lower rocker-pin may be accepted as approximately
correct, although some designers slightly increase
beyond these points. On the other hand, the
locomotives sent out from a leading building establishment
have the radius of link drawn ¾ inch per foot
short of the distance between the axle and rocker; and
the claim has been made, that the arrangement produces
an excellent motion.</p>

<p>A committee of the American Master Mechanics’
Association have placed themselves on record on this
subject by asserting that the distance between the
centers of axle and rocker-pin is the proper radius for
the link. That same committee recommended that the
link-motion should be planned to give as long a link-radius
as possible, subject to the first-mentioned conditions.</p>

<p>It must be noted that the middle of the link-slot is
the radius arc. I knew of a case where the links for
an altered locomotive were finished out of the true
radius through the edge of the slot being taken as the
radius-curve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>243</span></p>

<h3>INCREASE OF LEAD.</h3>

<p>Most of the men who are at all familiar with the
valve-motion are aware of the fact, that, with the shifting
link, the lead increases as the link is notched towards
the center. Where the valve has 1/16 inch lead in full
gear, it is no unusual thing to find it increase to ⅜ inch
lead opening at mid gear. The phenomenon is better
known than its cause is understood.</p>

<div id="i_13" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 19em;">
  <img src="images/i_p243.png" width="304" height="104" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span></div></div>

<p>The relative positions of link and eccentric centers
of an engine, when the crank is on the forward center,
are shown in <a href="#i_13">Fig. 13</a>; the link being represented with
the block in the center, which represents mid gear. It
will be observed that the centers of the eccentrics <i>f</i>
and <i>b</i>, from which the rods receive direct influence, are
both some distance ahead of the center of the axle, the
one above, the other below. The eccentric-straps to
which the rods are connected sweep round the eccentric
circles, and are controlled thereby. When the link is
moved up or down, each eccentric-rod pin, where it
attaches to the link, describes the arc of a circle with
a radius drawn from its own eccentric. If both rods
were worked with a radius from the axle-center, the
link could be raised and lowered when the engine
stands on the dead center, without moving the rocker-pin
at all; but, under the existing arrangement, the link<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>244</span>
is influenced directly by one or other of the eccentrics,
whatever position in the link the block may stand.
When the engine is standing on the forward center,
with the link in mid gear, as shown in <a href="#i_13">Fig. 13</a>, it will
be readily perceived that the block stands at its farthest
point away from the axle; for the rods are so placed
to reach their greatest horizontal distance ahead, and
consequently in this position the lead opening is greatest.
If the link be now lowered, the backing eccentric-rod
will immediately begin to pull the link back: and,
as the pin of the forward eccentric-rod approaches the
central line of motion, it will also keep drawing the link
back; so that, by the time the link is in full gear, the
lead opening will be considerably reduced.</p>

<div id="i_14" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 20em;">
  <img src="images/i_p244.png" width="309" height="107" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.</span></div></div>

<p>When the engine stands on the back dead center, as
shown in <a href="#i_14">Fig. 14</a>, the eccentric centers will be on the
other side of the axle, and the eccentric-rods will be
crossed. While in mid gear, the link-block is drawn
closer to the axle than it would be in any other position
of the link; and consequently the lead opening
is greatest. If the link be now lowered, the forward
eccentric-rod will approach its horizontal position, and
consequently reaches farther on the central line of
motion, so it will push the link-block away from the
axle, thereby decreasing the lead. Pulling the link into
back gear has a similar effect.</p>

<p>The tendency of a link-motion to increase the lead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>245</span>
towards the center is made greater by shortening the
eccentric-rods. Increasing the throw of eccentric inclines
to accelerate the lead towards the center, since
it throws the eccentric centers farther apart. For slow
running, hard-pulling locomotives, where increase of
lead is a disadvantage, the tendency to increase the lead
is sometimes restrained in forward gear by reducing
the angular advance of the backing eccentric. This
expedient is, however, not necessary where proper care
and intelligence have been bestowed in the original
design of the motion.</p>

<p>In studying this part of the valve-motion, a young
machinist or engineer will obtain valuable assistance by
cutting a link template out of a piece of pasteboard,
and using strips of wood as eccentric-rods. With these
he can test on a drawing-board or table the various
positions of the link, and note, in a way that is easily
understood, the effect of changing the link into different
positions.</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>SETTING THE VALVES.</i></span>
</h2>
</div>

<h3>THE MEN WHO LEARN VALVE-SETTING.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Most</span> of intelligent machinists engaged on engine-work,
make it an object of ambition to learn to set
valves; and the operation is mastered as soon as the
opportunity offers. It has been a practice in numerous
shops for those who have the work of valve-setting to
do, to invest the operation with fictitious mystery,
to patiently disseminate the belief that valve-setting is
an exceedingly difficult matter. Cases sometimes arise
where the squaring of an engine’s valves is really an
arduous task, requiring intimate familiarity with delicate
methods of adjustment; but valve-setting, as it is
usually practiced in building establishments, in repairing-shops,
and in round-houses, is merely a matter of
plain measurement.</p>

<p>A man may be a first-class engineer without knowing
how to set valves, and familiar acquaintance with
the operation will not increase his ability in managing
his engine when merely getting a train over the road
on time is the consideration; but the method of valve-setting
is so closely associated with an intelligent appreciation
of the valve-motion’s philosophy, that most of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>247</span>
engineers who take an extended interest in their business,
wish to acquire the knowledge of how the valves
are set.</p>

<h3>BEST WAY TO LEARN VALVE-SETTING.</h3>

<p>The best way to learn valve-setting is by taking part
in the work. Whatever can be said in books on a subject
of this kind, provides but an indifferent substitute
for going through the actual operations. But a man’s
ambition to learn may exceed his opportunities; so, for
those who can not get a gang boss to direct them into
the art of valve-setting, this description will be made as
plain as possible.</p>

<p>When an engine’s valve-motion is designed, the sizes
of the different parts are arranged; and, if this business
is done by a competent engineer, there will only be
trifling changes necessary in valve-setting.</p>

<h3>PRELIMINARY OPERATIONS.</h3>

<p>Let us suppose the engine to be an ordinary eight-wheel
locomotive, with cylinders 17 × 24 inches. Let
us assume that the top and bottom rocker-arms are
straight, of equal length, and that the eccentric-rods are
connected to the link so as to be opposite the block in
full gear. This will make the extreme travel of valve
equal the eccentric’s throw. We will now look round
to see that every thing connected with the motion is
ready for valve-setting.</p>

<p>First, it is necessary to see that the wedges are properly
set up to hold the driving-boxes in about the same
position they will occupy when the engine is at work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>248</span></p>

<h3>CONNECTING ECCENTRIC-RODS TO LINK.</h3>

<div id="i_15" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24em;">
  <img src="images/i_p248.png" width="384" height="128" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span></div></div>

<div id="i_16" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24em;">
  <img src="images/i_p248b.png" width="373" height="122" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span></div></div>

<p>In looking over the motion, it is well to note that the
eccentric-rods are properly connected,—the forward
eccentric-rod with the top, the backward eccentric-rod
with the bottom, of the link. When the crank-pin is on
the forward center, the eccentrics will occupy the position
they appear in, in <a href="#i_15">Fig. 15</a>, where the rods are open,
and nearly horizontal. The full parts of both eccentrics
are advanced towards the crank-pin, so that the centers
of the eccentrics are advanced from a perpendicular
line drawn through center of axle, a horizontal distance
equal to the lap and lead. When the crank-pin is on
the back center, the eccentric centers will be behind the
axle, and the rods will be crossed as they are seen in
<a href="#i_16">Fig. 16</a>. The reason why the rods must be crossed
when the crank is in this position, is, that the forward
eccentric center is below the axle, and the backward
eccentric center is above. As the forward eccentric-rod<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>249</span>
maintains its connection with the top of the link, and
the backward eccentric-rod is at the opposite end,
crossing of the rods is inevitable. This fact is worth
imprinting on the memory, for I have known of several
cases where men got the rods up wrong by putting
them open when the engine stood with the crank on
the back center.</p>

<h3>MARKING THE VALVE-STEM.</h3>

<div id="i_17" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img src="images/i_p249.png" width="389" height="121" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.</span></div></div>

<p>In ordinary practice, valves are set with the steam-chest
cover down, and the position of the valve on the
seat is identified by marks on the valve-stem. Before
the cover is put down, the valve is placed as in <a href="#i_17">Fig. 17</a>,
just beginning to open the forward steam-port; a thin
piece of tin being generally used to gauge the opening.
When the valve stands in this position, a tram is extended
from a center punch-mark <i>c</i>, on the stuffing-box,
straight along the valve-stem as far as it will reach; and
the point, here located at <i>a</i>, is marked. The valve is
then moved forward till it begins to uncover the back
port, when another measurement is made with the tram,
which locates the point <i>b</i> on the valve-stem. Whatever
position the valve may stand on, it may now be
identified by the tram. When the tram cuts the space<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>250</span>
half way between <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, the valve stands in the middle
of the seat.</p>

<p>Some machinists do not believe in tramming from the
stuffing-box, as the point is liable to be moved in tightening
down the steam-chest cover. These generally
measure from a point on the cylinder casting, but that
practice has its drawbacks.</p>

<h3>LENGTH OF THE VALVE-ROD.</h3>

<p>To prove the correct length of the valve-rod, the
rocker-arm is set at right angles to the valve-seat,
which is its middle position. The valve must now
stand on the middle of the seat, which will be indicated
by the tram point reaching the dividing point between
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. Should the valve not be right when the rocker
is in its middle position, the rod must be altered to put
it right.</p>

<h3>ACCURACY ESSENTIAL IN LOCATING THE DEAD CENTER POINTS.</h3>

<p>Before proceeding to set the valves, a machinist can
not be too careful in locating the exact dead centers.
Some men conclude, because there is little motion to
the cross-head close to the end of the stroke, that a
slight movement of the wheel to one side or the other
is of little consequence, and makes no perceptible difference
in the relative positions of piston and valve. This
is a serious mistake; for, although the piston is moving
slowly, the eccentric is proceeding at its ordinary speed,
and the valve is moving fast. The loose, quick methods
of finding dead centers followed occasionally are not
conducive to exactness, and nothing but accuracy is
permissible in valve-setting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>251</span></p>

<h3>FINDING THE DEAD CENTERS.</h3>

<p>The best way of finding the true center is by moving
the cross-head a measured distance round its extreme
travel, recording the extent of movement on the driving-wheel
tire, whose motion is uniform; then bisecting
the distance between the marks on the tire, when the
dividing line will indicate the true center.</p>

<div id="i_18" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img src="images/i_p251.png" width="400" height="188" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span></div></div>

<p>Thus: Turn the wheels forward till the cross-head
reaches within one-half inch of its extreme travel, as
shown in <a href="#i_18">Fig. 18</a>. From a point <i>a</i> on the guide-block,
extend a tram on the cross-head, and mark the extreme
point reached <i>b</i>. Put a center punch-mark <i>c</i> on the
wheel-cover, or other convenient fixed point, and from
it extend a tram on the edge of the tire, and scratch an
arc <i>d</i>. Now, with tram in hand, watch the cross-head,
and have the wheels moved forward slowly. When
the cross-head passes the center, and moves back till the
tram extending from <i>a</i> will reach the point <i>b</i>, stop the
motion. Again tram from the wheel-cover point, and
describe a second arc on the tire, which will be at <i>e</i>,
now moved to the position which <i>d</i> occupied when the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>252</span>
previous measurement was taken. With a pair of dividers
bisect the distance between <i>d</i> and <i>e</i>. Mark the
dividing point <i>C</i> with a center punch, and put a chalk
ring round it. When the wheel stands so that the
tram will extend from <i>c</i> to <i>C</i>, the engine will be on the
forward dead center.</p>

<p>All the other centers must be found by a similar
process.</p>

<h3>TURNING WHEELS AND MOVING ECCENTRICS.</h3>

<p>When a measurement is going to be made for fore
gear, the wheels must be turned forward; and, when it
is for the back gear, they must be turned backward.
Enough movement of the wheel must be given to take
up the lost motion every time the direction of movement
is changed. In moving an eccentric, it should
also be turned far enough in the opposite direction to
take up the lost motion.</p>

<h3>SETTING BY THE LEAD OPENING.</h3>

<p>Put the reverse-lever in the full forward notch, and
place the engine on the forward center. If the lead
opening in full gear is to be 1/16 inch, advance the forward
eccentric till the point <i>a</i> (<a href="#i_17">Fig. 17</a>) on the valve-stem
is that distance away from the tram point. Throw
the reverse-lever into the full backward notch, turn the
wheels forward enough to take up the lost motion, then
turn them back to the forward center. Move the backward
eccentric (if it needs moving) till the tram, extended
on the valve-stem, strikes the same point that it
reached for the forward motion. It will be noted here,
that the valve occupies the same position for fore and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>253</span>
back gear when the engine is on the center. Put the
reverse-lever in the forward notch again, and turn the
wheels ahead till the back center point is reached. Now
tram the valve-stem again, and, if the lead opening be
the same for both gears as it was on the forward center,
that part of the setting is right. It is a good plan to go
over the points a second time to prove their correctness.
But it is not likely that the lead opening at the back
end will be right on the first trial. Instead of having
the correct lead, the valve will probably lap over the
port, being what workmen call “blind,” or it will have
too much lead. Let us assume that our valve is 1/16 inch
blind. This indicates that the eccentric-rod is too long.
We shorten the rod till the valve is at the opening
point, and, on turning the engine to the forward center
again, we will find that the valve there has lost its lead.
But our change has adjusted the valve movement, so
that on each center the valve is just beginning to open
the steam-port. Advancing the eccentric to give one
end 1/16 inch lead will now have the same effect upon
the other end; and, assuming that the back motion has
been subjected to similar treatment with a like result,
the lead opening on that side is right. This process
must now be repeated with the other side of the engine.</p>

<h3>ASCERTAINING THE POINT OF CUT-OFF.</h3>

<p>The lead openings being properly arranged, we will
proceed to examine how the valves cut off the steam;
for it is important that about the same supply of steam
should be furnished to each cylinder and to each end of
the cylinders. The angularity of the connecting rod<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>254</span>
tends to give a greater supply of steam to the forward
than to the back end of the cylinder; but this inequality
is, as has already been explained, usually rectified by
locating the hanger-stud a certain distance back of the
link arc.</p>

<p>To prove the cut-off, we will try the full gear first.
Put the reverse-lever in the full forward notch, starting
from the forward center, and turn the wheels ahead.
The motion of our engine has been designed so that
the cut-off in full gear shall happen at 18 inches of the
stroke. With tram in hand, watch the movement of
the valve as indicated by the stem marks. As the
piston moves away from the forward end of the cylinder,
the valve will keep opening till nearly half stroke
is reached, when it will begin to return, slowly at
first, but with increasing velocity as the point of cut-off
is reached. When the point <i>a</i>, <a href="#i_17">Fig. 17</a>, gets so that
it will be reached by the tram extended from <i>c</i>, the motion
must be stopped; as that indicates the point of cut-off.
Now measure on the guide how far the cross-head
has traveled from the beginning of the stroke, and mark
it down with chalk. Then turn the wheels in the same
direction past the back center, and obtain the cut-off
for the forward stroke in the same manner. The cut-off
for the other cylinder will be found in precisely the
method described.</p>

<p>In addition to trying the cut-off in full gear, it is
usually tested at half stroke and at 6 inches, or with
the reverse-lever in the notches nearest to these points.
Some men begin at the first notch, and follow the point
of cut-off in every notch till the center is reached, and
do the same for back gear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>255</span></p>

<h3>ADJUSTMENT OF CUT-OFF.</h3>

<p>From various causes, it often happens that the cut-off
is unequal in the two strokes, or one cylinder may be
getting more steam than the other. Suppose, that, on
one side of the engine, the valve is cutting off at 18½
inches in forward gear, while at the other side it is cutting
off at 17½ inches of the stroke. The most ready
way to adjust that inequality is by shortening one link-hanger
and lengthening the other till a mean is struck.
Where the discrepancy is smaller, it is adjusted by
lengthening the hanger at the short side.</p>

<p>A harder inequality to adjust is where the valve cuts
off earlier for one end of the cylinder than for the other.
In new work this is readily overcome by the saddle-stud,
but such a change is seldom admissible in old work.
When the points of cut-off have been noted down, it will
frequently happen, that, instead of both ends cutting off
at 18 inches, one end will show the cut at 17 inches,
while the other goes to 19 inches. This indicates
something wrong, and demands a search for the origin
of the unequal motion. First ascertain if the rocker-arm
is not sprung. If that is all right, examine the
link, which is probably sprung out of its true radius.
To straighten the rocker-arm is an easy matter, but not
so with case-hardened links; although some men are
very successful in springing them back. Where it is
impracticable to remedy an unequal cut-off by correcting
the origin of the defect, several plans may be resorted
to for obtaining the required adjustment. One
of the most common resorts is to equalize the forward
motion by throwing out the back motion. Putting the
rocker-arm away from its vertical position when the valve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>256</span>
is in the middle of the seat, by shortening or lengthening
the valve-rod, provides a means of adjustment.
Sometimes the equality of lead opening is sacrificed
to obtain equality of cut-off. The changes necessary to
obtain adjustment of a distorted motion can only be
successfully arranged by one who has experience in
valve-setting or in valve-motion designing.</p>

<p>In many shops the cut-off is adjusted for the point
where the engine does most of the work,—say at 6
inches. Other master mechanics direct the equalization
to be made for half stroke, while some take the
mean between the half stroke and the ordinary working
notch.</p>

<p>The final adjustments in valve-setting ought to be
made when the engine is hot.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span></div></div>

<p>In the following article we propose to explain how
this can be accomplished.</p>

<p>Although we would not advise any person to be satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>258</span>
with approximate rules or constructions, yet cases
do occur where the approximate constructions, being so
very near correct, on account of their simplicity, are of
greater practical value than the application of the rigid
and more difficult theoretical rules.</p>

<p>By these remarks, we do not wish the reader to understand
that the following constructions are all done
according to the rules of thumb—not by any means;
for all, with the exception of a few points, are theoretically
correct. At the end of this article, we will point
out those points which are, and which are not, approximately
found; so that the reader may feel satisfied that
our construction may always be relied upon as being
correct for all practical purposes.</p>

<p>In what follows, the cylinder will always be regarded
as lying on the right-hand side of the axle, the link
being between cylinder and axle, and the axle located
in the center of pedestal.</p>

<p>To avoid any misunderstanding, we will explain the
meaning of some of the terms used.</p>

<p>The length of crank is the distance from center of
axle to center of crank-pin.</p>

<p>For convenience, we shall call the total distance from
center of eccentric-strap to the center of eccentric-pin
in the link the length of the eccentric-rod.</p>

<p>The throw of eccentric is double the distance from
center of axle to center of eccentric-wheel.</p>

<p>The length of the connecting rod is the distance from
the center of crank-pin hole to center of cross-head
pin-hole.</p>

<p>The length of link-hanger is the distance from center
to center of holes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>259</span></p>

<h3>CONDITIONS.</h3>

<p>Since this article treats only on the adjustment of
the link-motion, the following items are supposed to be
known and established: The lap of valve, which in this
case will be three-fourths of an inch; the throw of
eccentrics, 5 inches; the stroke of the piston, 24 inches;
the position of the rocker, as per <a href="#i_19">Fig. 19</a>; the length
of the rocker-arms, which are in this case of equal
length; length of link-hanger and all dimensions of
link, complete, as shown in <a href="#i_19">Fig. 19</a>; and also the length
of the connecting rod.</p>

<p>The adjustment of the link-motion may at first sight
appear to be a difficult problem, as we must have a
knowledge of the relative motions of the piston and
slide-valve; but by reducing this problem to several
elementary problems, so that the laws governing the
relative motions may be discovered and clearly defined,
a clear conception of our subject can be gained, and
the solution of our original problem can be accomplished
with comparative ease.</p>

<p>In order to find what kind of elementary problems
are applicable, let us suppose that we are looking at
a locomotive with a link-motion, as shown in <a href="#i_19">Fig. 19</a>,
applied and correctly adjusted. Now let us examine
it, commencing with the valve. We find that the valve
receives its motion from the upper rocker-arm, and
this receives its motion from the lower rocker-arm.
According to our conditions, previously stated, both of
the rocker-arms are of the same length; and, therefore,
the arc described by the upper rocker-arm will be the
same length as the arc described by the lower one.
We also notice that the link which moves the lower<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>260</span>
rocker-arm is held in position by the lifting-shaft arm.
The question, then, will naturally arise, Must this lifting-shaft
arm have some particular length, and the
center of lifting-shaft have some particular position?
We answer, “Yes;” and this is one of our elementary
problems to solve. Again, we notice that the saddle-pin
is not in the center of the link; and we ask again,
“Why?” To answer this will be another elementary
problem. The next we notice are our eccentric-rods.
These we find, on examination, to have some particular
length; and to find this length is another elementary
problem. Next we examine our eccentrics: these, we
find, are fastened to the axle; and, since the crank is
also fastened to the same axle, it follows that there are
some relative positions between them; to find these
positions is another elementary problem. Now let us
look once more at the rocker, and we find that the two
rocker-arms are not in the same straight line: hence, to
find the amount of offset is another elementary problem.
And, lastly, we must be able to find the position
of crank-pin to correspond with the position of piston
when at full stroke at either end of the cylinder, and
also when at half stroke moving in either direction.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have all the elementary problems that
are necessary to be understood for the solution of our
original problem.</p>

<p>We will now explain all these problems, in an order
the reverse to that in which we stated them; hence we
have the following <span class="locked">order:—</span></p>

<p>1st, To find position of crank at full and half stroke.</p>

<p>2d, To find center line of motion, and amount of
offset in rocker-arms.</p>

<p>3d, To find relative positions of crank-pin and eccentrics<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>261</span>
when at full and half stroke.</p>

<p>4th, To determine the correct length of eccentric-rods.</p>

<p>5th, To find position of saddle-pin.</p>

<p>6th, To find the position of the center of lifting-shaft
and length of arms.</p>

be in the same straight line as <i>AD</i>, <a href="#i_20">Fig. 20</a>. With
any point <i>C</i> as a center, and a radius equal to the
length of the crank, describe a circle <i>F</i>, ½<i>F</i>, <i>B</i>, ½<i>B</i>; and
let us call this the crank-pin circle. The straight line
<i>AD</i> intersects the circumference of the circle in the
points <i>F</i> and <i>B</i>. The point <i>F</i> will be the center of
crank-pin when piston is at full stroke at the forward
end of the cylinder, and point <i>B</i> will be the center of
crank-pin when the piston is at full stroke at the rear
end of the cylinder. With the point <i>F</i> as a center, and
with a radius equal to the length of the connecting rod,

the straight line <i>AD</i> in the point <i>C′</i>. Point <i>F′</i> will
be the center of cross-head pin when the center of
crank-pin is at <i>F</i>, and <i>B′</i> the center of cross-head pin
when the crank-pin is at <i>B</i>, and the point <i>C′</i> will be the
position of center of cross-head pin when piston is at

equal to the length of the connecting rod, describe an
arc passing through the point <i>C</i>, and intersecting the
crank-pin circle in the points ½<i>F</i> and ½<i>B</i>: these points
will be the position of crank-pin when the piston is at
half stroke, or when the center of cross-head pin is
at <i>C′</i>.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span></div></div>

<p>It often happens that the axis of the cylinder is above
the center of axle. When such is the case, we must
follow the construction as shown in <a href="#i_21">Fig. 21</a>. Let two
inches be the distance that the center of axis of cylinder
is above the center of axle.</p>

<p>Draw a straight line <i>AD</i> through the center of axle
<i>C</i>; two inches above this draw a straight line <i>GH</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>263</span>
parallel to <i>AD</i>; this line will then pass through the axis
of cylinder. With the center of axle <i>C</i> on the straight
line <i>AD</i> as a center, and a radius equal to the length
of the crank, describe a circle <i>F</i>, ½ <i>F</i>, <i>B</i>, ½ <i>B</i>: this circle
will be the crank-pin circle. With the point <i>C</i> as a
center, and a radius equal to the length of the connecting
rod plus the length of the crank, describe an arc
intersecting the straight line <i>GH</i> in the point <i>F′</i>: this
point will be the position of the cross-head pin when
the piston is at full stroke forward. Through the
points <i>F′</i> and <i>C</i> draw a straight line, intersecting the
crank-pin circle in the point <i>F</i>: this point will be
the position of the center of the crank-pin when the
piston is at full stroke forward. Again, with the point
<i>C</i> as a center, and a radius equal to the length of the
connecting rod minus the length of the crank, describe
an arc intersecting the straight line <i>GH</i> in the point
<i>B′</i>: this point will be the position of the center of the
cross-head pin when the piston is at full stroke in the
rear end of the cylinder. Through the points <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>
draw a straight line, intersecting the crank-pin circle in
the point <i>B</i>: this point will be the position of the
center of crank-pin when the piston is at full stroke in
the rear end of the cylinder. Find a point <i>C′</i> exactly
central between the points <i>B′</i> and <i>F′</i> on the line <i>GH</i>:
in other words, bisect the distance <i>B′ F′</i> by the point
<i>C′</i>. With the point <i>C′</i> as a center, and a radius equal
to the length of the connecting rod, describe an arc
intersecting the crank-pin circle in the points ½<i>B</i> and
½<i>F</i>: these two points will be the center of crank-pin
when the piston stands at half stroke. In the link-motion,
as shown in <a href="#i_19">Fig. 19</a>, the axis of the cylinder is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>264</span>
supposed to be 2 inches higher than the center of axle.
For this reason the construction shown in <a href="#i_21">Fig. 21</a> will
hereafter be used.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Problem 2, <a href="#i_22">Fig. 22</a>.</span>—<i>To find the center line of
motion and the amount of offset in the lower rocker-arm.</i>—Let
<i>C</i> be the center of axle: through <i>C</i> draw the
straight lines <i>AD</i> and <i>KL</i> perpendicular to <i>AD</i>. The
center of rocker we find in <a href="#i_19">Fig. 19</a> to be 37½ inches in
front of the center of axle, and 7½ inches above. We
therefore continue our construction in <a href="#i_22">Fig. 22</a> by drawing
a straight line <i>MN</i> 37½ inches in front of, and parallel
to, the straight line <i>KL</i>, and another straight line
<i>OP</i> parallel to <i>AD</i>, and 7½ inches above it. These two
lines intersect in the point <i>Q</i>, and this point is the center
of rocker. With <i>Q</i> as a center, and a radius equal to
the length of the lower rocker-arm, describe the arc <i>RS</i>:
through the point <i>C</i> draw a straight line <i>CT</i> tangent to
the arc <i>RS</i>, then <i>CT</i> will be the center line of motion.</p>

<p>To find the amount of offset in the lower rocker-arm,
let us place the center line of the upper rocker-arm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>265</span>
perpendicular to a line drawn parallel to the valve
surface: but in our case this valve surface is parallel to
the line <i>AD</i>; hence our line drawn parallel to the valve
surface will also be parallel to the line <i>AD</i>, and the
center line of upper rocker-arm will be perpendicular
to <i>AD</i>, and coincide with the line <i>MN</i>. Through the
point <i>Q</i> draw a straight line perpendicular to the line
<i>CT</i>, and intersecting the arc <i>RS</i> in the point <i>U</i>: then
the distance from the point <i>U</i> to the line <i>MN</i> will be
the amount of the offset in the lower rocker-arm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Problem 3, <a href="#i_23">Fig. 23</a>.</span>—<i>To find the relative positions of
crank-pin and eccentrics when the piston is at full and half
stroke.</i>—Let <i>C</i> be the center of axle. Through <i>C</i> draw
the horizontal line <i>AD</i>, and find the positions of center
of crank-pin at full and half stroke; namely, the points
<i>F</i>, ½<i>F</i>, ½<i>B</i>, <i>B</i>, as explained in Problem 1, and shown in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>266</span>
<a href="#i_21">Fig. 21</a>. Next draw the center line of motion as explained
in Problem 2 and <a href="#i_22">Fig. 22</a>. With the point <i>C</i>
as a center, and a radius equal to ½ the throw of the
eccentric (2½ inches), draw a circle; and let us call this
circle the “eccentric-circle.” On the line of motion
<i>CT</i>, lay off a point towards the rocker 13/16 of an inch
from <i>C</i> (this being the sum of the lap and lead,—¾ of
an inch for the lap, and 1/16 of an inch for the lead):
through this point draw a straight line perpendicular to
the line of motion <i>CT</i>, and intersecting the eccentric-circle
in the points <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>. The point <i>x</i> will be the
center of the forward eccentric; and the point <i>y</i> will be
the center of backward eccentric when the center of
crank-pin is at <i>F</i>, full stroke forward. Through the
points <i>F</i> and <i>C</i> draw a straight line, intersecting
the eccentric-circle in the point <i>F″</i>. The line <i>FC</i> will
represent the center line of crank; and the distance
between the points <i>F″</i> and <i>x</i>, measured on the eccentric-circle,
is the amount that the center of forward
eccentric is set back of the center line of crank; and
the distance between the points <i>F″</i> and <i>y</i> is the amount
that the backward eccentric is set ahead of the center
line of crank. Since both the crank and eccentrics are
fastened to the same axle, it follows, that, whatever
position the center line of crank may be in, the distances
between center line of crank and eccentrics—that is, the
distances between <i>F″</i> and <i>x</i>, also <i>F″</i> and <i>y</i>, measured
on the eccentric-circle—remain constant. Therefore,
to find the position of eccentrics when the crank stands
at ½<i>F</i> (half stroke), draw the straight line ½<i>FC</i> representing
the center line of crank, and intersecting the eccentric-circle
in the point ½<i>F″</i>. From the point ½<i>F″</i>, lay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>267</span>
off on the eccentric-circle a point with a distance equal
to <i>F″x</i>, back of the center line of crank, and indicate
this point by ½<i>x</i>; also from ½<i>F″</i> measured on the same
circle, lay off a point in the front of the center line of
crank, and with a distance equal to <i>F″y</i>, and mark this
point ½<i>y</i>; then the point ½<i>x</i> will be the position of forward
eccentric, and the point ½<i>y</i> will be the position of
backward eccentric when the crank-pin is at ½<i>F</i>. In
precisely the same manner we find the position of
eccentrics when the center of crank-pin is at <i>B</i> (full
stroke back). Through the points <i>C</i> and <i>B</i> draw a
straight line, intersecting the eccentric-circle in the
point <i>B″</i>. From the point <i>B″</i>, and with a distance
equal to <i>F″x</i>, lay off a point on the eccentric-circle back
of crank; this point will be the position of forward
eccentric when crank is at full stroke back; and, in
order to distinguish this from the other position of
eccentric, call this point <i>a</i>: also from <i>B″</i>, lay off in
front of the crank the position of backward eccentric
at a distance equal to <i>F″y</i>, and call this point <i>b</i>. In
the same manner find points ½<i>a</i> and ½<i>b</i> when the crank-pin
is at ½<i>B</i>. We have now found the position of
eccentrics when the crank-pin stands in the following
<span class="locked">positions:—</span></p>

<p>Full stroke forward <i>F</i>, the forward eccentric will be
at <i>x</i>.</p>

<p>Half stroke forward ½<i>F</i>, the forward eccentric will

<p>Full stroke back end <i>B</i>, the forward eccentric will

<p><span class="smcap">Problem 4, <a href="#i_24">Fig. 24</a>.</span>—<i>To determine the correct
length of the eccentric-rods.</i>—Let <i>c</i> be the center of
axle. Through this point draw the horizontal line <i>AD</i>,
also a line <i>KL</i> perpendicular to <i>AD</i>. The only purpose
for which these two lines are drawn in this problem,
as well as the others, is to have some lines from
which we can locate other lines or points. Locate the
center of rocker, and center lines of rocker-arms, as
explained in Problem 2, and shown in <a href="#i_22">Fig. 22</a>; the lower
arm standing perpendicular to the center line of motion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>269</span>
and the upper arm vertical. When the arms stand in
this position, the rocker-pins will move through an
equal distance on each side of these center lines during
the time that the valve is making its full travel.</p>

<p>Next find centers of eccentrics <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> when the
crank is at full stroke forward; also <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> when
the crank is at full stroke back, as explained in Problem
3, and shown in <a href="#i_23">Fig. 23</a>. Before we proceed, let us give
names to some of the lines, as shown in <a href="#i_24">Fig. 6<i>a</i></a> (<a href="#i_24">p. 268</a>).
The arc <i>c<sub>1</sub>c<sub>2</sub></i> drawn through the center of opening of
the link, we will call the link-arc; and the arc <i>d<sub>1</sub>d<sub>2</sub></i>
drawn through the center of eccentric-rod pin-holes, we
will call the eccentric-rod pin-arc. Both of these arcs
are drawn from the same center; that is, the center
from which the link is drawn. Let us now cut a paper
template, as shown in <a href="#i_24">Fig. 6<i>b</i></a> (link structure). This
template is cut so that, if it is laid on the link, <a href="#i_24">Fig. 6<i>a</i></a>,
the arc of the template <i>c<sub>3</sub>c<sub>4</sub></i> will coincide with the link-arc
<i>c<sub>1</sub>c<sub>2</sub></i>, and <i>d<sub>3</sub>d<sub>4</sub></i> with the eccentric-pin arc <i>d<sub>1</sub>d<sub>2</sub></i>, the
end of template <i>d<sub>3</sub>c<sub>3</sub></i> with the line <i>d<sub>1</sub>c<sub>1</sub></i>, and the end
<i>d<sub>4</sub>c<sub>4</sub></i> with <i>d<sub>2</sub>c<sub>2</sub></i>. On this template join the points <i>c<sub>3</sub>c<sub>4</sub></i> by
a straight line, and bisect this line by the perpendicular
line <i>ee</i>: on this line the center of the saddle-pin will
be located. On one side of this line draw the line <i>ff<sub>1</sub></i>
parallel to <i>ee</i>, and on the other side draw <i>f<sub>2</sub>f<sub>3</sub></i> also parallel
to <i>ee</i>; the distance from the point <i>f</i> to the point
<i>f<sub>2</sub></i> being equal to the distance between the centers of
eccentric-rod pins, and <i>fe</i> equal to <i>ef<sub>2</sub></i>. The points <i>f</i>
and <i>f<sub>2</sub></i> on the arc <i>d<sub>3</sub>d<sub>4</sub></i> indicate the position on the
template of the centers of eccentric-rod pins. On the
center line of motion <i>cT</i>, lay off from <i>v</i> a point <i>v<sup>1</sup></i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>270</span>towards the axle, with a distance equal to <i>c<sub>1</sub>d<sub>1</sub></i>, <a href="#i_24">Fig. 6<i>a</i></a>;
then with the point <i>x</i> as a center, and <i>cv<sup>1</sup></i> as a radius,
describe the arc <i>x<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub></i>; in this arc the upper eccentric-rod
will be located as long as the center of forward
eccentric remains at <i>x</i>. With the point <i>y</i> as a center,
and <i>cv<sub>1</sub></i> as a radius, describe the arc <i>y<sub>1</sub>y<sub>2</sub></i>: in this arc
the center of lower eccentric-rod will be located as long
as the backward eccentric remains at <i>y</i>. With the
point <i>a</i> as a center, and <i>cv<sub>1</sub></i> as a radius, describe an arc
<i>a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub></i>: in this arc the upper eccentric-rod pin will be
located while the forward eccentric is at <i>a</i>. With the
point <i>b</i> as a center, and <i>cv<sub>1</sub></i> as a radius, describe the arc
<i>b<sub>1</sub>b<sub>2</sub></i>; and in this arc the center of lower eccentric-rod
pin will be located when the backward eccentric is at <i>b</i>.
Now adjust the template on the drawing so that the
point <i>f</i> will be in the arc <i>x<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub></i>: point <i>f<sub>2</sub></i> in the arc <i>y<sub>1</sub>y<sub>2</sub></i>
and the line <i>ee</i> coincide with the center line of motion
<i>cT</i>. Along the arc <i>c<sub>3</sub>c<sub>4</sub></i> of the template draw an arc
on the paper. Next move the template so that the
point <i>f</i> will be in the arc <i>a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub></i>, the point <i>f<sub>2</sub></i> in the arc
<i>b<sub>1</sub>b<sub>2</sub></i>, and the line <i>ee</i> coincide with the center line of
motion <i>cT</i>, and along the arc <i>c<sub>3</sub>c<sub>4</sub></i> of the template draw
the second arc on the paper. Now, if the distance
measured on the arc <i>RS</i> from the point <i>v</i> (the center
of the lower rocker-arm pin) to the first arc drawn, is
equal to the distance measured on the arc <i>RS</i> from <i>v</i>
to the second arc, the radius <i>cv<sub>1</sub></i> will be the correct
length of the eccentric-rods. But, if the distance from
<i>v</i> to the first arc is less than the distance from <i>v</i> to the
second arc, the length <i>cv<sub>1</sub></i> of the eccentric-rod will be
too short. In this case we must increase the length <i>cv<sub>1</sub></i>
by adding an amount equal to one-half the difference
of the distances from <i>v</i> to the first arc, and from <i>v</i> to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>271</span>
the second arc previously drawn; and this last length
so found will be the correct length of eccentric-rods.</p>

<p>It will be proper to remark here, that the radius <i>cv<sub>1</sub></i>
was assumed to be the correct length of eccentric-rods;
but since the rods cross each other when the eccentrics
are at <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, and do not cross each other when at <i>x</i>
and <i>y</i>, the radius <i>cv<sub>1</sub></i> will always be a trifle short. It is
therefore necessary to make the correction as explained.</p>

<p>In every case, the length of eccentric-rods must be
so adjusted, that, when the line <i>ee</i> coincides with the
center line of motion <i>cT</i>, the arc <i>vv<sub>2</sub></i> (which is the
amount that the rocker-pin is drawn towards the axle
from the line <i>Qv</i> when the eccentrics are at <i>a</i> and
<i>b</i>) must be equal to the arc <i>vv<sub>3</sub></i> (which is the amount
that the rocker-pin is moved towards the cylinders from
the line <i>Qv</i> when the eccentrics are at <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>); the
straight line <i>Qv</i> being perpendicular to the center line
of motion <i>cT</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Problem 5, <a href="#i_25">Fig. 25</a>.</span>—<i>To find the position of the
center of saddle-pin.</i>—For this problem we again call to
our aid the paper template shown in <a href="#i_24">Fig. 6<i>b</i></a>. We have
already seen in Problem 4 that the center of saddle-pin
will be located on the line <i>ee</i> drawn on this template:
it now only remains to determine the distance of this
point from the link-arc <i>c<sub>3</sub>c<sub>4</sub></i>.</p>

<p>Since the inequality between the crank-angle <i>W</i> and
<i>W<sub>1</sub></i>, <a href="#i_23">Fig. 23</a>, becomes the greatest when the crank stands
at half stroke, it is of the utmost importance to find such
a position for the center of saddle-pin that equal portions
of steam will be admitted alternately when the
crank stands at half stroke. Or, in other words, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>272</span>
admittance of steam must cease at the moment that
the piston has completed one-half stroke.</p>

<div id="i_25" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img src="images/i_p272.png" width="800" height="433" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 25.</span></div></div>

<p>Let us commence this problem as we began the others;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>273</span>
namely, Through the center of axle <i>C</i>, <a href="#i_25">Fig. 25</a>,
draw the horizontal line <i>AD</i>, also the vertical line <i>LK</i>.
Find the position of crank at half stroke, as shown in
<a href="#i_21">Fig. 21</a>. Next find the position of center line of motion
<i>CT</i>, and position of rocker, as shown in <a href="#i_22">Fig. 22</a>. Find
the relative position of eccentrics and crank when at
half stroke, as shown in <a href="#i_23">Fig. 23</a>. Now, with a radius
equal to the correct length of eccentric-rods, previously
determined (shown in <a href="#i_24">Fig. 24</a>), describe from the point
½<i>x</i> as a center, the arc ½<i>x<sub>1</sub></i> ½<i>x<sub>2</sub></i>; also with the point ½<i>y</i>
as a center, and with the same radius, the arc ½<i>y<sub>1</sub></i> ½<i>y<sub>2</sub></i>.
Again, from the point ½<i>a</i> as a center, describe the arc
½<i>a<sub>1</sub></i> ½<i>a<sub>2</sub></i>; also with the point ½<i>b</i> as a center, describe the
arc ½<i>b<sub>1</sub></i> ½<i>b<sub>2</sub></i>, using the length of eccentric-rods as a radius
for all the arcs.</p>

<p>When the center of the forward eccentric is at ½<i>x</i>,
the forward eccentric-rod pin will be located in the arc
½<i>x<sub>1</sub></i> ½<i>x<sub>2</sub></i>. When the center of the forward eccentric is at
½<i>a</i>, the forward eccentric-rod pin will be located in the
arc ½<i>a<sub>1</sub></i> ½<i>a<sub>2</sub></i>. When the backward eccentric is at ½<i>y</i>, its
eccentric-rod pin will be located in the arc ½<i>y<sub>1</sub></i> ½<i>y<sub>2</sub></i>.
When the center of the backward eccentric is at ½<i>b</i>, the
eccentric-rod pin will be located in the arc ½<i>b<sub>1</sub></i> ½<i>b<sub>2</sub></i>.</p>

<p>The next step is to find the relative position of the
lower rocker-arm pin when steam is cut off at half
stroke.</p>

<div id="i_25b" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27em;">
  <img src="images/i_p274.png" width="429" height="603" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 25</span><i>b</i>.</div></div>

<p>In <a href="#i_25b">Fig. 8</a> (<a href="#i_25b">p. 274</a>) we have placed the slide-valve centrally
over the ports, that is, it laps over each steam-port
an equal amount, namely, ¾ of an inch, which is
equal to the lap. In this position of the valve, the center
line of the upper rocker-arm will stand perpendicular<span class="pagenum hide"><a id="Page_274"></a>274</span>
to the line drawn parallel to the valve-face, and the
center line of the lower rocker-arm will stand perpendicular
to the center line of motion <i>CT</i>: hence the center
line of upper rocker-arm <i>MQ</i> in <a href="#i_25b">Fig. 8</a> will coincide<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>275</span>
with the line <i>MQ</i> in <a href="#i_25">Fig. 25</a>, and the center of lower
arm <i>QU</i> in <a href="#i_25b">Fig. 8</a> will coincide with the line <i>QU</i> in
<a href="#i_25">Fig. 25</a>.</p>

<p>Now let us follow the relative movement of the valve
and piston. We find, that, when the piston commences
its backward motion, the valve moves in the same direction, as
shown by the arrow-points in <a href="#i_25b">Fig. 8<i>a</i></a>; and, during
the time that the piston is completing the half stroke,
the valve has finished its full travel backward, and commenced
moving forward, as indicated by the arrow-points,
<a href="#i_25b">Fig. 8<i>b</i></a>; and, at the time that the piston stands exactly
at half stroke, the forward edge of the valve is just
closing the forward steam-port, and consequently cutting
off steam at half stroke when the piston is moving
backward. From this we see, that, when the piston has
completed the half stroke when moving backward, the
center of the valve will be a little in the rear of the center
of exhaust-port; the distance between the center of
valve and the center of exhaust-port being ¾ of an inch,
the amount of the lap: the upper rocker-pin will stand
¾ of an inch behind the line <i>MQ</i>, and the lower rocker-arm
pin will be ¾ of an inch in front of the line <i>QU</i>, as
shown in <a href="#i_25b">Fig. 8<i>b</i></a>. We therefore draw in <a href="#i_25">Fig. 25</a> a
straight line parallel to <i>QU</i>, and ¾ of an inch in front of
it: this line will intersect the arc <i>RS</i> in the point ½<i>F<sub>3</sub></i>;
and this point is the position of the center of lower
rocker-arm pin when the crank stands at ½<i>F</i>, and steam
cut off at half stroke. Let the piston complete its
backward stroke, and then commence moving forward
towards half stroke, as shown by the arrow-point, <a href="#i_25b">Fig. 8<i>c</i></a>.
During this time the valve has completed its full
travel forward, and commenced traveling backward, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>276</span>
indicated by the arrow-point, <a href="#i_25b">Fig. 8<i>c</i></a>; and, when the piston
stands exactly at half stroke, the rear edge of the
valve is just closing the rear steam-port, and consequently
cutting off steam at half stroke when the piston
is moving forward. In this position the center line of
the valve will be ¾ of an inch in front of the center of
exhaust, the center of the upper rocker-arm pin will be
¾ of an inch in front of the line <i>MQ</i>, and lower rocker-pin
¾ of an inch in the rear of the line <i>QU</i>, as shown in
<a href="#i_25b">Fig. 8<i>c</i></a>. We therefore draw in <a href="#i_25">Fig. 25</a> a line parallel
to <i>QU</i>, and ¾ of an inch behind it; this line will intersect
the arc <i>RS</i> in the point ½<i>B<sub>3</sub></i>; and this point will be
the position of the center of lower rocker-arm pin when
the crank stands at ½<i>B</i>, and steam cut off at half stroke.
Now, remember, that when the crank stands at ½<i>F</i>, <a href="#i_25">Fig. 25</a>,
the forward eccentric will be ½<i>x</i>, and the backward
eccentric at ½<i>y</i>; and, if the link is raised or lowered
while the eccentrics remain at ½<i>x</i> and ½<i>y</i>, the
forward eccentric-rod pin will move in the arc ½<i>x<sub>1</sub></i> ½<i>x<sub>2</sub></i>,
and the backward eccentric-rod pin will move in the arc
½<i>y<sub>1</sub></i> ½<i>y<sub>2</sub></i>.</p>

<p>Let us now find the position of link when steam is
cut off at half stroke at either end of the cylinder.</p>

<p>The points ½<i>F<sub>3</sub></i> and ½<i>B<sub>3</sub></i> in <a href="#i_25">Fig. 25</a> being located, place
the paper template on the drawing so that the point <i>f</i>
will lie in the arc <i>x<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub></i>, and the point <i>f<sub>2</sub></i> in the arc <i>y<sub>1</sub>y<sub>2</sub></i>,
and the link-arc <i>c<sub>3</sub>c<sub>4</sub></i> just touching the point ½<i>F<sub>3</sub></i>. While
the template is in this position, draw on the paper along
the edge <i>c<sub>3</sub>c<sub>4</sub></i> a portion of the link-arc, and mark the
position that the line <i>ee</i> occupied, so that, when the template
is removed, the line <i>e<sub>1</sub>e<sub>1</sub></i> can be drawn on the paper
to represent the line <i>ee</i> of the template. Next place<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>277</span>
the template so that the point <i>f</i> will lie in the arc
½<i>a<sub>1</sub></i> ½<i>a<sub>2</sub></i> the point <i>f<sub>2</sub></i> in the arc ½<i>b<sub>1</sub></i> ½<i>b<sub>2</sub></i> and the link-arc
<i>c<sub>3</sub>c<sub>4</sub></i> just touching the point ½<i>B<sub>3</sub></i> and, while in this position,
draw part of the link-arc <i>c<sub>3</sub>c<sub>4</sub></i> on the paper, mark
the position that the line <i>ee</i> occupied, and, after the template
is removed, draw the line <i>e<sub>2</sub>e<sub>2</sub></i> on the paper to represent
the line <i>ee</i> of the template. Now find by trial a
point <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> on the line <i>c<sub>1</sub>c<sub>1</sub></i>, and another point <i>x<sub>2</sub></i> on the line
<i>e<sub>2</sub>e<sub>2</sub></i>, so that the distances of these points from their link-arcs
are equal, and that a straight line drawn through
them will be parallel to the center line of motion.</p>

<p>The distance from <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> to the link-arc—or, which is
the same thing, the distance from the point <i>x<sub>2</sub></i> to the
link-arc—will be the correct distance between the center
of saddle-pin and the link-arc <i>c<sub>1</sub>c<sub>2</sub></i>, <a href="#i_24">Fig. 6<i>a</i></a>. Or, in
other words, the position of the point <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> or <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>, <a href="#i_25">Fig. 25</a>,
will indicate the proper position of the point of suspension
on the link. For future reference, let us mark this
point of suspension on the template, and indicate it by
<i>X</i>, <a href="#i_24">Fig. 6<i>b</i></a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Problem 6, <a href="#i_26">Fig. 26</a>.</span>—<i>To find the position of the
center of lifting-shaft and the length of its arms.</i>—In
the last problem we found the point of suspension of
the link, so that it will cause the valve to cut off
equal portions of steam when the piston stands at half
stroke. It now remains for us to find the position of
the lifting-shaft and the length of the lifting-shaft arms,
so that the greatest equal amounts of steam will be admitted
alternately at each end of the cylinder. Here a
little difficulty arises which needs explanation, so that
our construction may not seem inconsistent to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>279</span>
reader. It would be an easy matter to place our lifting-shaft
to accomplish the object just stated; but, if we do
this, the lead will not be equal at each end of cylinder
when the piston is at full stroke. Again, if we locate
our lifting-shaft in such a manner that equal lead will
be obtained, then the maximum cut-off will not be equal;
but the difference will be comparatively so small that it
will not injure the working of the engine. This small
difference of the maximum cut-off is therefore considered
among practical men of little or no importance, but
it is always considered good practice to have an equal
lead at full stroke. Let us therefore adjust the lifting-shaft
to obtain an equal lead, and allow us to consider
the maximum cut-off to be equal when the lead is equal
at full stroke.</p>

<p>For this problem we have to combine all the foregoing
problems. Through the center <i>C</i> of axle draw the
horizontal line <i>AD</i>, and the line <i>KL</i> perpendicular to it.
Find the positions of crank at full and half stroke, as
per Problem 1. Locate the rocker, draw the center
line of motion <i>CT</i>, and amount of offset in lower rocker-arm,
according to Problem 2. Next, locate the relative
positions of eccentrics when the crank stands at full and
half stroke, as explained in Problem 3. Then with a
radius equal to the correct length of eccentric-rods, as
explained in Problem 4, draw</p>

<p>Locate the points ½<i>B<sub>3</sub></i> and ½<i>F<sub>3</sub></i>, indicating the position

the position of the point of suspension of the link
when the piston is at full stroke forward end of cylinder,
and the crank-pin at <i>F</i>, the valve having 1/16 of an inch
lead, and the engine moving forward, as indicated by the
arrow-point 1; also the position of the point of suspension
of the link when the piston is at full stroke at the
opposite end of the cylinder, valve 1/16 inch lead, and
engine going in the same direction. To find these two
points, we must know the corresponding position of the
center of lower rocker-pin. In <a href="#i_25b">Fig. 8<i>a</i></a> we see, that
when the piston is at full stroke forward, and valve with
1/16 inch lead, the center of valve is 13/16 of an inch in the
rear of the center line of exhaust, and consequently the
lower rocker-pin will be 13/16 of an inch in front of the line
<i>QU</i>. In the same manner we can show that the center
of lower rocker-pin will be 13/16 of an inch in the rear of
the line <i>QU</i> when the piston is at the opposite end
of the cylinder.</p>

<p>Let us now locate the positions of the lower rocker-pin
in <a href="#i_26">Fig. 26</a>, by drawing a line parallel to and in front<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>281</span>
of <i>QU</i>, with 13/16 of an inch between them: this line will
intersect the arc <i>RS</i> in the point <i>F<sub>3</sub></i>, and this point will
be the center of lower rocker-pin when the piston is at
full stroke forward. Draw another line 13/16 of an inch in
the rear of <i>QU</i> and parallel to it: this line will intersect
arc <i>RS</i> in the point <i>B<sub>3</sub></i>, and this point will be the center
of rocker-pin when the piston is at full stroke in the
rear end of the cylinder. Now place the paper template
with the line <i>ee</i> below the center line of motion <i>CT</i>, the
point <i>f<sub>1</sub></i> on the arc <i>x<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub></i>, the point <i>f<sub>2</sub></i> on the arc <i>y<sub>1</sub>y<sub>2</sub></i>, and
the link-arc <i>c<sub>3</sub>c<sub>4</sub></i> just touching the point <i>F<sub>3</sub></i>, and, while in
this position, mark the point <i>X</i> of the template on the
paper, which can be done with the aid of a needle, and
indicate the point on the paper by <i>x<sub>3</sub></i>. This point will
be the position of the center of saddle-pin when the piston
is at full stroke in the forward end of the cylinder,
the valve having 1/16 inch lead. Again, slide the template
along until the point <i>f<sub>1</sub></i> is on the arc <i>a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub></i>, the
point <i>f<sub>2</sub></i> on the arc <i>b<sub>1</sub>b<sub>2</sub></i>, and the link-arc <i>c<sub>3</sub>c<sub>4</sub></i> in contact
with the point <i>B<sub>3</sub></i>; mark the point <i>X</i> of the template on
the paper, and indicate this point by <i>x<sub>4</sub></i>. This point will
be the position of the center of saddle-pin when the piston
is at full stroke in the rear end of the cylinder, the
valve having 1/16 inch lead. Secondly, to find the position
of the point of suspension of the link when the piston
is at full stroke in the forward end of the cylinder,
valve having 1/16 of an inch lead, and the engine moving
backward, as indicated by the arrow-point 2; also the
position of the point of suspension of the link when the
piston is at full stroke at the opposite end of the cylinder,
valve 1/16 of an inch lead, engine going in the same
direction. For this purpose, slide the template along<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>282</span>
until the line <i>ee</i> is above the line <i>CT</i>, and <i>f<sub>1</sub></i> in the arc
<i>a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub></i>, the point <i>f<sub>2</sub></i> in the arc <i>b<sub>1</sub>b<sub>2</sub></i>, and the link-arc <i>c<sub>3</sub>c<sub>4</sub></i> in
contact with the point <i>B<sub>3</sub></i>; mark the point <i>X</i> on the
paper, and indicate this point by <i>x<sub>5</sub></i>. This point will be
the position of the center of saddle-pin when the piston
is at full stroke in the rear end of the cylinder, valve
having 1/16 of an inch lead. Again, slide the template
along until the point <i>f<sub>1</sub></i>, will be in the arc <i>x<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub></i>, point <i>f<sub>2</sub></i>
in the arc <i>y<sub>1</sub>y<sub>2</sub></i>, and the link-arc <i>c<sub>3</sub>c<sub>4</sub></i> in contact with the
point <i>F<sub>3</sub></i>; mark the point <i>X</i> on the paper, and indicate
this point by <i>x<sub>6</sub></i>. This point will be the position of the
center of saddle-pin (or the point of suspension) when
the piston is at full stroke in the forward end of the
cylinder, valve 1/16 of an inch lead, engine moving backward.
Now, once more, with the point <i>x<sub>3</sub></i> as a center,
and with the length of the link-hanger as a radius, describe
an arc; and with the point <i>x<sub>4</sub></i> as a center, and the
same radius, describe another arc. These two arcs will
intersect each other in the point <i>g</i>. Again, with the
length of the link-hanger as a radius, and the points
<i>x<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub></i> as centers, describe two arcs intersecting each other
in the point <i>g<sub>1</sub></i>, with the points <i>x<sub>5</sub>x<sub>6</sub></i> as centers; and, with
the same radius, describe another two arcs intersecting
each other in the point <i>g<sub>2</sub></i>. Lastly, through the points
<i>g</i>, <i>g<sub>1</sub>g<sub>2</sub></i>, draw an arc. The center <i>h</i>, from which the arc
has been described, will be the center of the lifting-shaft,
and the radius <i>hg</i> or <i>hg<sub>2</sub></i> will be the length of
the lifting-shaft arms; that is, the length of the two
arms to which the link-hangers are attached: the length
of the other lifting-shaft arm, to which the reach-rod is
attached, is made to suit the other details of the engine.</p>

<p>When the admittance of steam ceases at the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>283</span>
time that the piston has reached the half stroke, the
practical man would say “that the valve is cutting off
equal at half stroke.” When the greatest equal volume
of steam is admitted alternately in each end of the cylinder,
the valve is said to be cutting off equal when the
link is in full gear.</p>

<p>It is always conceded among engineers, that when the
link-motion is adjusted to cut off equal at half stroke,
and also to cut off equal when the link is in full gear,
equal volumes of steam will be admitted alternately when
the link hangs at any intermediate point.</p>

<p>If, now, we examine Problem 5, we find, that, to obtain
an equal cut-off at half stroke, it is necessary to find the
proper position of saddle-pin.</p>

<p>Again, if we examine Problem 6, we find, that, in order
to obtain an equal cut-off when the link is in full gear,
also an equal cut-off for any point between full gear
and half stroke, we have to determine the proper position
of the center of lifting-shaft and the correct length
of its arms.</p>

<p>Lastly, if we examine the first four problems, we find
them simply to be preparatory problems.</p>

<p>According to promise, we will draw attention to those
points which have been, and others which have not been,
approximately found. Problems 1, 2, and 3 are theoretically
correct. In Problems 4, 5, and 6, the use of
the template will not be admitted for theoretical reasoning;
but, if the construction is made with absolute
accuracy, the result will be theoretically correct.</p>

</div>

<h3>DESCRIPTION OF MOTION</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">This</span> motion has been designed by A. J. Stevens,
General Master Mechanic, Central Pacific Railroad, to
overcome the well-known objections to the link-motion,—viz.,
letting the steam escape early in the stroke when
the engine is running hooked up; also, the closing of
the exhaust-port early, leading to excessive compression.
The motion is developed from the Walschaert
motion, well known in Europe, and applied to some
extent to narrow-gauge engines in this country.</p>

<h3>ARRANGEMENT OF THE MOTION</h3>

<div id="i_27" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 57em;">
  <img src="images/i_p288.png" width="900" height="447" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 27.</span></div></div>

<p>In the Stevens motion two valves are employed, one
at each end of the cylinder, as can be seen in <a href="#i_27">Fig. 27</a>.
The valves have supplementary passages for steam and
exhaust, being an improvement on the Allen valve.
Valves without the supplementary exhaust-port have
been designed by Mr. Stevens for his engines, and they
are shown in two positions in the supplementary figures
2 and 3 [<a href="#i_27">p. 288</a>]. These valves closely resemble the
Allen valve; but, in operating, steam is admitted to,
and exhausted from, the cylinder through the same passage.
This arrangement provides double area of admission<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>289</span>
and double area for exhaust steam,—an important
consideration, especially with high piston speed.</p>

<h3>VALVE MOVEMENT</h3>

<p>The valves are actuated by two motions,—one taken
from a single eccentric, the other derived from a connection
with the cross-head. The single eccentric is
used to give both forward and backward motion, and is
set in the proper angle to the crank to produce motion
in either direction. For reversing the motion of the
valve, a curved rocker-arm <i>R</i> (<a href="#i_27">Fig. 27</a>) is used, on which
moves a sliding-block <i>r</i>. Attached to the sliding-block
is the link <i>H</i>, which connects with the lap-and-lead
lever <i>D</i>. The lower end of this lever is attached by
the link <i>d</i> to the cross-head, from which the lever receives
an oscillating motion. This lever is suspended
by a hanger from any convenient part of the engine.
Projecting from one side of the lap-and-lead lever are
two pins, to which are connected the valve-stem rods <i>m</i>
and <i>n</i>. These pins are set upon the lever at points
between 90 and 180 degrees apart, so as to give a
differential movement to the valve, which can not be
obtained when the pins are set opposite on the lever.</p>

<h3>VALVE-STEMS AND STUFFING-BOXES.</h3>

<p>Each valve has its own rod, and separate connection
with the lever. In most instances the stem of the back
valve is made hollow, and the stem of the forward valve
is passed through it, so as to avoid the use of more than
one stuffing-box upon the steam-chest; but in several
instances they have been fitted up with two stuffing-boxes,
the separate valve-stems working side by side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>290</span></p>

<h3>HOW MOVEMENT OF VALVE IS GOVERNED.</h3>

<p>The valve being coupled up by independent rods to
the lap-and-lead lever, they will move together, and in
the same general direction, from the action of the eccentric.
But besides this movement, common to both, each
valve is controlled and acted on by the angular position
of the two pins, which results from the rotary or oscillating
movement of the lap-and-lead lever upon its center;
and each valve, instead of having a uniform rate of
travel, has a variable movement. The degree of this
variable movement is governed, both by the distance of
the pins from the center upon which the lever works
and the length of the lever, and can be increased or
diminished by changing the position of one or the length
of the other in construction. The horizontal movement
of the valve received from the lap-and-lead lever while
the same is at mid travel, is very slight, while the piston
or the cross-head is traveling very rapidly. By this
slow movement of the valve, steam is retained in the
cylinder until the piston has nearly completed its stroke;
and, on the other hand, the exhaust is kept open. As
the cross-head approaches either end of the stroke, the
action of the valves is very much accelerated, receiving,
as they do, their motion from the combined action of the
lap-and-lead lever and the eccentric.</p>

<h3>HOW EXHAUST LEAD IS CONTROLLED.</h3>

<p>The exhaust lead is controlled by the pin in the lap-and-lead
lever, which is on the center, or horizontal,
when the cross-head is at either end of the cylinder.
The steam lead is controlled by the pin that is vertical,
or above the center of the lap-and-lead lever, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>291</span>
the cross-head is at either end of the stroke. Both
steam and exhaust lead are uniform at all points of cut-off.
By this arrangement of the valve-gear and valves,
steam can be cut off at any point of the stroke (by
moving the sliding-block toward the center of the
rocker-arm), and is retained, if desired, to the last inch
of the stroke. In receiving, the steam is evenly distributed
at all points of the cut-off.</p>

<p>There are about as many pieces to this gearing as to
the ordinary link-gear; but it is considerably cheaper in
construction, and much more durable; while it does
away with two eccentrics, and their straps and connections.</p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION OF MOTION.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">In</span> this form of valve-gear, eccentrics and their equivalents
are entirely dispensed with. The motion for the
valve is taken direct from the connecting rod; and by
utilizing independently the backward and forward action
of the rod, due to the reciprocation of the piston, and
combining this with the vibrating action of the rod up
and down, a movement results which is employed to
actuate the valves of engines using any combination of
lap and lead desired, and giving an almost mathematically
correct cut-off for both sides of the piston for
forward and backward motion, and for all points of expansion
intermediately. The general outline of the
motion can be understood by an examination of <a href="#i_28">Fig. 28</a>,
which gives three views of the gear. The sub-figures
1, 2, and 3 show the motion in elevation, plan, and
transverse section respectively.</p>

<h3>HOW TO APPLY THIS GEAR TO AMERICAN LOCOMOTIVES.</h3>

<p>To apply this gear, the valve and steam-chest are
placed, as is usually the case in American locomotives,
over the cylinders; the valve-stem center being, however,
in the same vertical plane as the cylinder center
line, immediately over it. All the valve-motion is thus
arranged on this plane,—perfectly central,—and there
are no crooked or side strains. To a point <i>A</i> on diagram,
about two-fifths along the connecting rod from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>294</span>
the piston end, a small hook-link is pinned. From the
lower end of this at <i>D</i> is jointed a lever <i>E</i>, which, of
course, moves with the connecting rod both backward
and forward, and up and down; the point <i>D</i>, in fact,
moving in a very irregular ellipse, hereafter explained.
The fulcrum <i>F</i> of the lever <i>E</i> is carried in a block which
slides in a slot-link <i>JK</i>, and from the upper end of this
lever <i>E</i> the valve-stem rod <i>G</i> is carried to the valve.
This slot-link <i>JK</i> is centered so as to be able to be inclined
from the vertical either way. When standing in
the vertical position, the engine is in mid-gear, and the
valve will only be opened for lead; but this will be exact
for each end, and exact also on either side of the center
line of the connecting rod. When the slot-link is inclined
forward to the front of the engine, the engine is
in full gear forward; and, when inclined backwards, it
is in full gear for going back. Placed in any intermediate
position, the cut-off is regulated for any required
degree of expansion; the front and back of the piston
receiving equal cut-off, or equal amounts of steam.</p>

<h3>CONSTRUCTION DIRECTIONS.</h3>

<p>In laying out this valve-motion, it is necessary to
make the center or fulcrum <i>F</i> of the lever <i>E</i> coincide,
when the crank is at either extreme stroke, with the
center on which the slot-link <i>JK</i> vibrates: then these
two centers coinciding when the engine stands at lead
(that is, at either end of the stroke), the slot-link <i>JK</i>,
which is, in fact, the reversing agent, may be put forward
or backward through all degrees, without moving
the valve, which thus has constant lead at all grades of
expansion.</p>

<p>If, however, it is desired to give increasing or decreasing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>295</span>
lead in the grades of expansion, this may be
given by varying the coincidence of these two centers
accordingly, or by under-correcting or over-correcting
the action of the lever <i>E</i>, by varying the position of <i>D</i>
on the link <i>B</i>.</p>

<h3>HOW LAP AND LEAD ARE REGULATED.</h3>

<p>The lap and lead together are dependent on the distance
between the center <i>F</i> of lever <i>E</i>, and the center
from which the motion is taken for the valve.</p>

<h3>ADVANTAGES CLAIMED FOR THE MOTION.</h3>

<p>The first advantage claimed for Joy’s valve-gear over
the link-motion is, that it is considerably less costly,
and that the working-parts are lighter. The saving is
not only in weight, however, but also in the greater
simplicity of parts, allowing increased facility for tooling
and fitting.</p>

<p>It may be needless to point out how readily this
valve-motion is adaptable to the requirements of the
typical American locomotive, considerably simplifying
the present form of valve-motion, by dispensing with
the eccentrics and other working-parts, and bringing the
gear with all its strains into a direct line, and also leaving
the whole of the under part of the engine clear, and
permitting a considerable extension of the fire-box,—a
most valuable feature.</p>

<p>All the parts are such that they can be readily made
by machinery, dispensing with hand labor except in
putting them together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>296</span></p>

<h3>ACTION OF THE MOTION.</h3>

<p>The action transmitted to the valve is altogether different
from that transmitted by the link-gear, as by this
gear it results from the two distinct motions of the
connecting rod imparted to the lever <i>E</i>; and these two
motions work variously, with and against each other,
thus giving to the valve a resultant motion somewhat
partaking of the nature of that produced by cams, it
really being an accelerated and retarded motion; these
accelerations and retardations being so arranged as to
come at the right time on the revolution to give the
desired result.</p>

<p>Thus, as the crank is passing over the center, the
lever <i>E</i> is not affecting the valve at all as a lever, but
the motion imparted to the valve is due to the center
of <i>E</i> slipping down the curve of the slot-link <i>J</i>; and this
gives a smart opening of the lead with a continued smart
opening of the port. When the valve is fully open, as
the crank travels on, the lever <i>E</i> has commenced acting
on the valve; but its center is still sliding down the
slot-link <i>JK</i>; and the two movements are opposite and
destroying, or partially destroying, each other, producing
a retardation of the valve-motion almost amounting to
an arrest; and thus is given a nearly straight line on a
valve-path diagram where the port is kept fully open,
the crank still traveling on, and approaching the time
for the cut-off to be effected. The lever <i>E</i> is in the
best position to act as a lever at the same time that its
center is completing its movement in the slot <i>JK</i>, and
is commencing to return, being practically still: thus
the lever action of <i>E</i>, having full effect, rapidly closes
the port. And so on for the revolution, the time of
release also getting its benefit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>298</span></p>

<h3>RULES FOR LAYING DOWN THE CENTER LINES OF THE MOTION.</h3>

<div id="i_29" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 57em;">
  <img src="images/i_p297.png" width="900" height="389" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29.</span></div></div>

<p>Lay down the center line <i>aa</i> (<a href="#i_29">Fig. 29</a>) of the cylinder,
and that of the valve-stem <i>bb</i>, at the relative distances
required for the engine to which the application is to be
made; the valve-stem center line being, however, in the
plane of the vibration of the connecting rod. Draw the
path of the crank-pin, and the center lines of the connecting
rod <i>cc</i><sup>1</sup><i>c</i><sup>1</sup> for both upper and lower positions
when the piston is at half stroke. Take a point <i>d</i> on
the center line of the connecting rod, where its vibration
between <i>d</i><sup>1</sup> and <i>d</i><sup>2</sup> is equal to about double the
length of the full stroke of the valve (it is better to
allow rather more than less). It may, however, be
chosen very much to suit the other arrangements of the
engine, such as the position of the guides, brackets, etc.,
getting, however, if possible, a vibration of the connecting
rod fully equal to double the stroke of the valve, to
avoid too great an angle of the slide-link when put over
for full forward or backward gear.</p>

<p>Having chosen the point <i>d</i>, draw a vertical line <i>zz</i>
through it and at right angles to <i>aa</i>, and mark off the
two points <i>e</i>, <i>e</i>, on each side, these being the extreme
positions of the point <i>d</i> on the connecting rod for front
and back stroke; from these points draw lines to a point
<i>f</i> on the vertical, so far down that the angle between
them shall not be more than 90°,—less is better, if
there is room to allow of it (these will represent the
center lines of the first link pinned to the connecting
rod). The point <i>f</i>, which will rise and fall with the
vibration of the connecting rod, is to be controlled as
nearly as may be on the vertical line by a link pinned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>299</span>
forward near the cylinder at <i>f</i><sup>1</sup>, or, if more convenient,
it can be pinned backward.</p>

<p>Next, on the valve-stem center line <i>bb</i>, mark off on
each side of the vertical <i>zz</i> the amount required for lap
and lead together, at <i>g-g</i><sup>1</sup> and <i>g-g</i><sup>2</sup>; <i>g-g</i><sup>1</sup> being lap and
lead for the front end of the cylinder, and <i>g-g</i><sup>2</sup> being lap
and lead for the back end of the cylinder. Then, assuming
the piston to be at the front of the cylinder, and
the centers of the connecting rod to be at <i>hh</i><sup>1</sup> (<i>h</i> being
the crank-pin), the point <i>d</i>, which we have chosen to
take motion from, will be at <i>e</i><sup>1</sup>, and the link pinned to
the connecting rod, for transmitting motion to the valve,
will be at <i>e</i><sup>1</sup> <i>f</i>. From a point on this link, which has at
first to be assumed, say at <i>j</i> (which will be about the
half vibration of the connecting rod; that is, <i>d</i><sup>1</sup> to <i>d</i>),
draw the center line of the lever actuating the valve,
that is joining <i>j</i> and <i>g</i>; the point where this line crosses
the vertical <i>zz</i>, will be the center or fulcrum of the lever,
and will also be the center of oscillation of the curved
links in which the blocks carrying the center of the
lever slide; this center is marked <i>m</i>. The function of
the link <i>e</i><sup>1</sup> <i>f</i>, and the attachment of the valve-lever to it
at <i>j</i>, is to eliminate the error in vibration of the lever,
center <i>m</i>, which would otherwise arise from the arc
passed through by the lower end of that lever. Although
the position of the point <i>j</i> may be found by calculation,
it is much more quickly found by a tentative
process; and, to test it the assumed point <i>j</i> be the correct
one, we mark off on each side of <i>m</i>, vertically, the
correct vibration required, <i>n</i><sup>1</sup> <i>n</i><sup>2</sup>, which will be the same
as the vibration of the connecting rod on the vertical
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>300</span>line <i>zz</i>. Then apply the distance <i>e</i><sup>1</sup>—<i>j</i> to <i>d</i><sup>1</sup>—<i>j</i><sup>1</sup> and
<i>d</i><sup>2</sup> <i>j</i><sup>2</sup>. Then, if the length <i>jm</i> be applied to <i>j</i><sup>1</sup> <i>n</i><sup>1</sup> (measuring
from <i>j</i><sup>1</sup>), and to <i>j</i><sup>2</sup> <i>n</i><sup>2</sup> (measuring from <i>j</i><sup>2</sup>), and the
point <i>m</i> fall below <i>n</i><sup>1</sup> <i>n</i><sup>2</sup> in each case, it will be necessary
to take a point on <i>e</i><sup>1</sup> <i>f</i> higher than <i>j</i>; or if, on the other
hand, <i>m</i> falls above <i>n</i><sup>1</sup> <i>n</i><sup>2</sup>, then a point must be taken on
<i>e</i><sup>1</sup> <i>f</i> lower than <i>j</i>. This point will generally be found
on a second trial.</p>

<p>The point <i>m</i>, as said, now represents the center of
oscillation for the links and the center or fulcrum of the
lever. And these must coincide, when the piston is at
each end of the stroke, the lead being then fixed; and
the links can be pulled over from forward to backward,
or any point of expansion, without altering the lead.
This may be taken as a test of the gear being set out
correctly.</p>

<p>The point <i>g</i> will be the point of attachment for the
valve-stem link, which may be made any convenient
length; but, from that length as a radius, the curve of
the links must be drawn from a center <i>m</i><sup>1</sup> on the parallel
line <i>m</i>-<i>m</i><sup>1</sup>; the angle at which this curve is set
from the vertical (which is mid-gear), will give forward
or backward gear,—the angle leaning forward <i>s</i><sup>1</sup>, or to
the front of the engine, being forward gear, and the
reverse <i>s</i><sup>2</sup> being backward gear. The amount of the
angle, marked on the curve of extreme vibration at <i>s</i>-<i>s</i><sup>1</sup>
or <i>s</i>-<i>s</i><sup>2</sup>, will be equal to one-quarter more than the full
opening of the port at that angle (that is, if 1″ opening of
port is required, then the amount of angle <i>s</i> to <i>s</i><sup>1</sup> must
be 1¼″), and the point of cut-off will be about 75 per
cent. Laid out in this form, the leads and cut-offs for
both ends of the cylinder, and for backward and forward
going, will be practically perfect and equal, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>301</span>
opening of ports also as near as possible equal. If a
longer cut-off than 75 per cent is required, it is only
necessary to increase the angle of the curve <i>oo</i> beyond
<i>s<sup>1</sup></i> for forward gear, or beyond <i>s<sup>2</sup></i> for backward gear. It
will be noticed, that, in this gear, the lap and lead are entirely
dependent on the action of the lever <i>j</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>g</i>, as a
lever, and may be varied according to the length of <i>mg</i>.
And the opening of the port (beyond the amount given
as lead) is dependent on the amount of angle imparted
to the curved link <i>oo</i>, and will be, as above said, about
four-fifths of the amount of that angle from the vertical
measured on the line of extreme vibration.</p>

<p>Deviations from the above positions and proportions
may be made without materially altering the correctness
of the results.</p>

<p>Thus, if it is found necessary to raise or lower the
center <i>m</i>, to clear wheels, frames, or other gear, this
may be done till the angle of <i>mm<sup>1</sup></i> is out of the parallel
of the cylinder center line up or down by one in thirteen
(1 in 13); it is not well to go beyond this; but
the lines <i>mm<sup>1</sup></i> and <i>bb</i> will be parallel, and the position
of the curve <i>oo</i> for mid-gear will be at right angles to
<i>mm<sup>1</sup></i>.</p>

<p>Again, the point <i>e<sup>1</sup></i> may be taken either above or
below the center line of the connecting rod, if it be
wished to avoid piercing the rod; the pin at <i>e<sup>1</sup></i> being
carried in a small bush or block attached above or below
the connecting rod.</p>

<p>Again, for locomotives, if the wheels are so small
that the link <i>e<sup>1</sup>f</i> would come too low, it may be cut
short at the point <i>j</i>, and this point connected by a link
<i>ll</i> to a small return-crank <i>p</i>, on the crank-pin; the movement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>302</span>
of the counter-crank being equal to that from
to <i>j<sup>4</sup></i>.</p>

<p>The diagram is drawn for an engine where the center
of the crank-axle is on the center line of the cylinder;
but if this be below, as is usual in American locomotives,
then the base line on which to construct the diagram
of the valve-gear itself will be the average center
line assumed by the connecting rod for such lowering
of the crank-axle center, drawn from <i>c</i>, the middle position,
to a point, say <i>r</i>, representing the lowered center
of the axle. The vertical <i>zz</i> will be at right angles to
this new base line <i>cr</i>, all the other processes following.</p>

<p>While the proportions shown on the diagram give
the best average results, these proportions may be varied
within very wide limits, according to the requirements
of the design of the engine. Thus, when the
distance between the center of the cylinder and center
of valve-stem is small, as with a small cylinder and a
long stroke, the link <i>e<sup>1</sup>f</i> may be considerably lengthened:
the point <i>j</i> will thus be dropped, and convenient
angles for all the links, etc., will be maintained, the
room for the various movements being got below the
center line of the cylinder when it can not be had
above; the reverse proportioning of the parts being
made when the conditions are reversed, as with a large
diameter of cylinder and a short stroke.</p>

<p>This system of laying out the motion, applies, with a
few modifications, to the Strong motion, and to all others
where the ellipse formed by the horizontal and vertical
motion of the main rod is used to actuate the valves.</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>THE STEAM ENGINE INDICATOR.</i></span>
</h2>
</div>

<h3>PURPOSE OF THE INDICATOR.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">In</span> the course of these pages, reference has several
times been made to the indicator. This instrument is
of great service to the steam engineer in helping him to
determine with accuracy questions of steam distribution,
that, without its aid, would remain in the realms
of speculation. Its diagram presents a reliable record of
what is going on inside the cylinders of a steam engine;
and master mechanics who desire to run their engines
economically, can not afford to dispense with the accurate
information imparted by the indicator respecting
individual locomotives.</p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION OF INSTRUMENT.</h3>

<p>The indicator consists essentially of a small steam
cylinder, whose under side is connected by pipes to the
main cylinder of the engine under inspection. Inside
the indicator cylinder is a nicely fitting piston, whose
upward movement is resisted by a spring of known
strength. The piston-rod passes up through the top of
the indicator cylinder; and its extremity is connected
with mechanism for operating a pencil, and marking on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>304</span>
a card a diagram whose lines coincide with the movement
of the indicator piston.</p>

<h3>OPERATION OF THE INDICATOR.</h3>

<div id="i_30" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22em;">
  <img src="images/i_p304.png" width="347" height="445" alt="" />

<div id="i_31" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 22em;">
  <img src="images/i_p305.png" width="346" height="446" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 31.</span></div></div>

<p><a href="#i_30">Fig. 30</a> is a perspective view of the Tabor indicator,
an instrument well adapted for application to high-speed
engines, such as the locomotive. In <a href="#i_31">Fig. 31</a> the
indicator is shown in section. The construction of the
instrument can be well understood from a careful examination
of these figures. In the sectional figure, the
piston is seen with its rod encircled by the spring passing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>305</span>
up through the top of the cylinder, and connecting
with the lever which operates the marking-pencil. By
ingeniously designed mechanism, the lever is made to
move the pencil in a perfectly straight vertical line.
The card to be marked is fastened in the paper drum
attached to the indicator. This drum receives a circular
motion from a cord which is operated by the cross-head,
and this connection is so arranged that the drum
will begin to move round just as the main piston begins
its stroke. The circular motion of the drum is continued
till the piston reaches the end of its stroke, when the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>306</span>
drum reverses its movement, and returns to the exact
point from whence it started. Now the indicator cylinder
being in communication with the main cylinder,
when the latter begins to take steam, the pressure will
be applied to the indicator piston, which is pushed upward,
at the same time transmitting its movement to
the pencil. The indicator piston will rise and fall in
accordance with the steam-pressure in the cylinder; and,
the circular movement of the drum coinciding with the
cross-head movement, the pencil will describe a diagram
which represents the pressure inside the main cylinder
at the various points of the stroke.</p>

<h3>LINES OF THE DIAGRAM.</h3>

<div id="i_32" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24em;">
  <img src="images/i_p306.png" width="369" height="240" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 32.</span></div></div>

<p><a href="#i_32">Fig. 32</a> represents an indicator diagram, such as
might be taken from a locomotive with well-constructed
valve-motion cutting off steam at about one-third of the
stroke. In the figure, the line <i>IJ</i> represents the line<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>307</span>
that would be drawn by the pencil when no steam is
admitted to the indicator piston; so it is called the atmospheric
line. This is the neutral line of the diagram
representing the position of the pencil when both sides
of the indicator piston are exposed to the atmosphere:
hence it is the base line from which pressures either
above or below are measured. The line <i>AB</i> is the admission
line, so called because its beginning <i>A</i> represents
the point where the valve begins admitting steam
to the cylinder: <i>BC</i> is the steam-line, usually considered
as beginning at the point of positive change in direction
of the admission line. Admission of steam does not
cease till the point <i>D</i> is reached, but wire-drawing begins
at <i>C</i>. The curve <i>DE</i> is the expansion line, and is traced
while the valve is closed, and previous to the opening of
the exhaust; the pressure falling by expansion. At <i>E</i>,
release begins, and the exhaust line extends to <i>F</i>; from
<i>F</i> to <i>G</i> is the line of counter-pressure, drawn during the
return stroke of the piston and while the exhaust is
open; and <i>G</i> to <i>A</i> is the compression line, drawn during
the return stroke after the exhaust-valve has closed.</p>

<h3>DATA NECESSARY FOR ANALYZING THE DIAGRAM.</h3>

<p>In proceeding to ascertain from the diagram calculations
of the work done by the engine, it will be remembered
that vertical measurements represent pressures
in the cylinder, and horizontal measurements positions
of the piston. To understand the language of the diagram
properly, it is necessary that several things having
reference to permanent or accidental conditions be
known. Those absolutely necessary are, the scale of
the indicator spring, the diameter of the engine cylinder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>308</span>
and stroke of the piston, the strokes made per
minute, and the boiler pressure. It is also desirable to
know the dimensions of steam-pipes, steam-ports, and
exhaust nozzles.</p>

<h3>ADVANTAGES OF INDICATING LOCOMOTIVES.</h3>

<p>The purposes for which the indicator can be advantageously
applied to locomotives, are to show the condition
of the valves and pistons, and to prove whether or
not the steam is used properly within the cylinders. By
its use the amount of power developed by the cylinders
can be computed.</p>

<p>Were the indicator used daily on locomotives, much
waste of coal now going on through steam being lost by
leaky valves and pistons would be avoided. The graphic
tale of the diagram would force out of practice the ordinary
habit of running engines with the steam throttled,
and indubitable proofs of ruinous back pressure would
make contracted nozzles intolerable.</p>

<p>There is not room in a work of this kind to give the
necessary information for those who wish to learn the
operating of the indicator and the analysis of the diagram.
Engineers who are ambitious to enter upon this
line of study, should secure one of the standard books
treating the subject.</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>THE WESTINGHOUSE AIR-BRAKE.</i></span>
</h2>
</div>

<h3>INVENTION OF THE WESTINGHOUSE ATMOSPHERIC BRAKE.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">In</span> this exacting age, the traveling public are much
more disposed to find fault with systems that do not
provide against fatalities resulting from human fallibility,
than to commend the perfection of appliances
which annually save more lives than would be lost in
a sanguinary war. The Westinghouse brake has performed
this life-saving service, yet its great conserving
merit has been but feebly appreciated outside of railroad
circles. During the decade between 1860 and
1870, America became a reproach among nations for
the frequency and disastrous nature of its railroad
accidents. To-day fewer railroad travelers in America
lose their lives by accidents beyond their own control,
than the travelers in any country under the sun. The
credit of this immunity from fatal accidents is almost
entirely due to the successful operation of the Westinghouse
and other brakes that followed the line suggested
by this invention.</p>

<h3>DISTINCT CLASSES OF INVENTIONS.</h3>

<p>Inventions may be divided into two distinct classes.
Far the more numerous class are those which effect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>310</span>
improvements on recognized appliances. The other is
the rare and more valuable class, to which belongs the
original inventor who devises an entirely new method
for performing a desired operation. Among this class
of inventions may be noted Watt’s separate condenser,
which first rendered the steam engine a commercial
success; the multitubular boiler of Nathan Read, which
made a high-speed locomotive practicable; and the air-brake
of Westinghouse, which made fast traveling safe,
by putting the train speed under the control of the
engineer.</p>

<h3>BENEFITS CONFERRED ON TRAIN MEN BY GOOD BRAKES.</h3>

<p>To the traveling public the air-brake has proved a
source of satisfaction by assuring exemption from accidents,
but its greatest blessing has been conferred upon
train men. Being the greatest sufferers from railway
accidents, their risks of life and limb are greatly reduced;
and the agonizing helplessness that used to
be so often experienced with trains that could not be
stopped in time to avoid a disaster, is almost unknown
on our well-managed roads. Mind has become victor in
its conflict with matter. When necessary, an engineer
can run a train at a high velocity over crowded lines
without having to shut off steam within a mile of each
point where there may be another train obstructing the
track, or keep up his speed at the risk of his life. People
unacquainted with the inside operating of railroads
have no idea of the difficulties train men had to contend
with in getting fast trains over the road, before
continuous brakes were supplied. The train had to be
run on schedule time, and all points where trains might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>311</span>
be expected had to be approached with care. This
meant reduced speed; and speed could not be reduced
in short distances, so the risk had to be taken of violating
one rule to comply with another.</p>

<h3>FIRST TRIALS OF THE WESTINGHOUSE ATMOSPHERIC BRAKE.</h3>

<p>The Westinghouse atmospheric brake was patented
April 13, 1869; and the first public trial took place on
the Panhandle road about the same time. The trial
was so satisfactory, that the Pennsylvania Railroad
Company, which have been always noted for their liberal
patronage of every meritorious device likely to promote
the efficiency and safety of railroad operating, had a
train equipped with the brake. This was the Walls
accommodation train, a kind of service where frequent
stops were required, and was therefore well calculated
to demonstrate the true character of any brake. A
number of public trials were made with the brake thus
fitted, among which was one by the Master Mechanics’
Association in the middle of September, 1869, on the
Horseshoe Bend on the Pennsylvania Railroad. Here
a train of six cars, running down a grade of 96 feet to
the mile, at the rate of 30 miles an hour, was stopped
in a distance of 420 feet. Such a feat was unprecedented
at that time, and attracted wide-spread attention.</p>

<p>In the following month, official trials of the train were
made by the officers of the Pennsylvania Railroad near
Philadelphia. The train was then taken to Chicago,
where numerous tests were made in the presence of
leading Western railroad officers. So convincing were
these trials of the decided efficiency of the brake, that,
immediately afterwards, the Michigan Central Railroad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>312</span>
and the Chicago and North-Western Railway each
ordered a train to be fitted with the brake.</p>

<h3>FIRST ROADS THAT ADOPTED THE WESTINGHOUSE BRAKE.</h3>

<p>The first five sets of the Westinghouse brake fittings
made were got out in the shops belonging to the Pennsylvania
Railroad Company at Altoona, Penn. The
first railroads to adopt the brake as a regular part
of their equipment, were the Pennsylvania, the Pittsburg,
Cincinnati, and St. Louis, the Union Pacific, the
Chicago and North-Western, and the Michigan Central
Railroads.</p>

<p>Since the Westinghouse atmospheric brake was first
tried, many changes in details have been made, and
numerous improvements have been effected; but the
essential points remain the same. And the best forms
of brakes subsequently got out by other inventors are
founded on the Westinghouse idea, just as much as the
numerous types of locomotives follow the design of
Stephenson’s Rocket.</p>

<h3>OUTLINES OF THE ATMOSPHERIC BRAKE.</h3>

<p>Although the automatic air-brake is now becoming
almost universal in American railroad practice, most
train men are familiar with the working of the atmospheric
brake under the name of “straight air.” When
first invented, the Westinghouse brake consisted of an
apparatus located on the locomotive for compressing
air, which was stored in an iron drum fastened somewhere
about the engine. Underneath each car, and
connected with the ordinary brake attachments, was a
cylinder containing a piston, which operated the brake.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>313</span>
The brake-cylinders were kept in communication with
the air-drum on the locomotive by iron pipes. Connection
between the cars where “stretching” and “compression”
made the train vary in length, was made by
means of rubber flexible hose. When the engineer
wished to apply the brakes, he admitted the compressed
air into the supply pipes, through a three-way cock at
his hand. This air entered the cylinders under the
cars, moving back the pistons which pulled the levers
operating the brakes. To release the brakes, the air
was permitted to escape out of the pipes into the
atmosphere.</p>

<p>Thus, what is really a complicated operation was performed
in a simple manner, and by means of machinery
not liable to get out of order readily. The instant
application of every brake on a long train was put in
the hand of the engineer. On the first indication of
danger, his hand became powerful beyond the magical
forces conceived by the imagination of poets.</p>

<h3>HOW EASTERN RAILROADS KEPT ALOOF FROM THE WESTINGHOUSE
BRAKE.</h3>

<p>The growth of the Westinghouse brake into public
favor furnishes a curious commentary on the different
degrees of enterprise to be found among railroad companies
in the various sections of this country. It was
natural to suppose that railroads in the thickly settled
States, where trains had become too numerous for
being safely operated with crude brakes, and no signals,
would have been the first to adopt an improved appliance
which gave promise of increased safety. Yet the
railroads in the Eastern States, with a few creditable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>314</span>
exceptions, were among the last to patronize the Westinghouse
brake; and they adopted it only when the
influence of public opinion could no longer be ignored.
Western railroads that ran through sparsely settled
prairies, where trains were rare, and stopping room
generally ample, were among the first to encourage the
inventor of the brake with their support.</p>

<h3>LESSON OF THE REVERE RAILROAD ACCIDENT.</h3>

<p>During the first two years after it was invented, the
Westinghouse brake made slow progress into practical
application, except in the West. In the ancient State
of Massachusetts, it was hardly known till the Revere
accident happened near Boston. This was the case of a
crowded road being operated without signals or brakes,
except those of the most primitive description. A fast
express train ran into the rear end of an accommodation
train, killing twenty-nine persons, and severely
injuring fifty-seven others. The engineer of the express
train, while running at a speed of twenty-five
miles an hour, saw the tail lights of the accommodation
train when he was eight hundred feet away. He
whistled for brakes, and reversed his engine; but the
train could not be stopped.</p>

<p>The railroad superintendents throughout the conservative
State of Massachusetts then received enlightenment
respecting the existence of an efficient continuous
brake in a vigorous fashion. The Revere accident
conveyed its lessons in a terrible way, but they were
effectual in convincing railroad managers that they
could not afford to dispense with a brake that proved
itself to be reliable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>315</span></p>

<h3>WEAK POINTS OF THE ATMOSPHERIC BRAKE.</h3>

<p>Although the atmospheric brake could, with light
trains, make stops within the shortest distance it was
desirable to stop trains with safety to the passengers
and rolling stock, it possessed certain weak points
which demanded remedy. In case of a train breaking
in two,—an accident which frequently happens, especially
on rough track,—there was danger of the engineer
applying the brake without knowing that an
interval existed between the cars, and allowing the rear
end of the train to crash into the forward part. The
signal given by the bell-rope breaking, had a tendency
to lead to an accident of this character. Another objection
to straight air was, that should derailment take
place, or any accident happen that would rupture the
pipes or their connections, the brake was rendered useless.
These weak features did not interfere with the
working of ordinary traffic; and as providing special
appliances to meet cases of accident which are rare,
does not generally receive much consideration, the
brake might have been regarded as perfect enough for
all practical purposes had it not failed to meet satisfactorily
a condition of ordinary train service. As the
length of trains was increased, it was found that the
atmospheric brake was slow in action. When a long
array of pipes and many cylinders had to be charged
with air from the drum on the locomotive after the necessity
for applying the brake became apparent, and
before it would act, some seconds were required for the
operation. Every additional car put upon the train
increased the length of pipes and the cylinders to be
filled, and so lengthened the time that elapsed between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>316</span>
the instant danger was perceived and the time at which
the brake began to perform its retarding work. The
increase of time might be only a few seconds, but they
would probably be priceless moments when an accident
was impending.</p>

<h3>THE WESTINGHOUSE AUTOMATIC AIR-BRAKE.</h3>

<p>To overcome this line of weakness, the Westinghouse
automatic air-brake was invented. Where good station
signals are in use, it has long been accepted as an axiom
among railway authorities, that a signal must be constructed
so that it will indicate danger when any accident
happens to its mechanism. This principle was
brought into practical application in the Westinghouse
automatic air-brake. When any thing goes wrong with
the brake apparatus, its tendency is to apply the brake
automatically. A break in a pipe makes the brake fly
on. Each car carries a supply of compressed air sufficient
to apply its own brakes several times. By the
new arrangement, the brakes on all the cars are applied
almost simultaneously, and instantly after the engineer
turns the handle of his stopping-valve. The brakes are
applied by decreasing the pressure in the pipes; so the
breaking in two of the train, or the fracture of an air-pipe
or coupling, sets the brakes on all the cars on the
train, whatever side of the break the cars may be on.
That in itself is an invaluable feature in a continuous
brake, and prevents cars from acting as battering-rams
upon each other in cases of derailment.</p>

<h3>LIFE-SAVING VALUE OF THE AUTOMATIC BRAKE.</h3>

<p>Every few days, notices get into the public prints<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>317</span>
relating how frightful accidents were prevented by the
prompt action of the automatic air-brake. And hundreds
of narrow escapes, where this brake proves the
preventive of destruction to life and property, receive
no record, and are known only to the employes connected
with the operating of trains. To the men
familiar with train service, to those who are intimately
acquainted with the life-saving effected by the automatic
air-brake, it seems surprising that railroads could
have been operated without this or a similar appliance.
They certainly were not operated safely without it.</p>

<h3>FIRST RAILROADS THAT ADOPTED THE WESTINGHOUSE AUTOMATIC
AIR-BRAKE.</h3>

<p>Patents for the Westinghouse automatic air-brake
were granted in March, 1872. During the succeeding
winter, trials of the brake were made by the Pennsylvania
Railroad; and it was shortly afterwards adopted by
the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company as
their standard brake for passenger trains. The example
of that company was soon followed by the St. Louis,
Kansas City and Northern, the Chicago and Alton,
the Toledo, Wabash and Western, and the St. Louis,
Iron Mountain and Southern Railroads, all of which
companies equipped their passenger rolling stock with
the automatic air-brake within a few months.</p>

<h3>ESSENTIAL PARTS OF THE WESTINGHOUSE AUTOMATIC AIR-BRAKE.</h3>

<p>The prominent features of the Westinghouse automatic
air-brake consist of the following leading parts:
An air-pump, placed on the locomotive, is operated by a
steam cylinder, which forces air into an iron drum or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>318</span>
reservoir placed under the deck, or in any other convenient
part about the engine. The air is compressed
to the density considered necessary for the kind of
train the locomotive usually pulls.</p>

<p>In the cab, located conveniently to the hand of the
engineer, is the engineer’s brake-valve, commonly called
the “three-way cock,” which regulates the flow of air
from the main reservoir into the main brake-pipes for
supplying the auxiliary reservoirs with air. This valve
applies the train-brakes by letting the air escape from
the main brake-pipes, and releases them by again admitting
the pressure of air into the pipes.</p>

<p>From the main reservoir, the main brake-pipe connects
with the engineer’s valve, and thence along the
train, supplying all the brakes with the air required.</p>

<p>Under the floor of each car is fastened an auxiliary
reservoir, which holds a supply of air necessary for operating
the brakes on that car. So each car carries its
own supply of air.</p>

<p>Connected with each car-truck is a brake-cylinder, in
which is operated a piston that applies the brake. The
brake-levers connect with the piston-rod in such a manner,
that, when the piston is forced out by the air-pressure,
the brake is applied.</p>

<p>Attached to the auxiliary reservoir is the triple valve,
whose action connects the air-cylinder with the auxiliary
reservoir.</p>

<h3>THE AIR-PUMP.</h3>

<p>When the air-brake was first invented, the distribution
of steam within the cylinder was effected differently
from what it is in modern pump-cylinders. The steam-valve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>319</span>
consisted of a double piston, the heads having
ports on their edges which admitted and released the
steam. This valve did not move up and down, but received
an oscillatory motion from a small auxiliary engine
placed on the top of the steam cylinder-head. The
movements of the auxiliary engine were regulated by a
reversing-rod (popularly known as a kicker-rod), working
inside the main piston-rod. This arrangement of
steam distribution was somewhat complicated, and liable
to get out of order; and it was superseded by the differential
steam-valve movement now in use.</p>

<h3>HOW THE AIR-PUMP WORKS.</h3>

<div id="i_33a" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 32em;">
  <img src="images/i_p320.png" width="499" height="660" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 33</span><i>a</i>.</div></div>

<p>In <a href="#i_33a">Fig. 33<i>a</i></a>, steam enters from the boiler at the nipple
35, and fills the steam-space between the heads of the
main piston-valve 15, 16, maintaining a constant pressure
of steam there while the pump is at work. The
upper head of the main valve being of greater area than
the lower one, the tendency of the pressure is to raise
the valve. A downward movement of the valve is provided
for by a separate single-headed piston-valve 20,
working in a cylinder above the main valve. The reversing-rod
12 operates a slide-valve 13, which regulates
the admission and release of steam for the third
piston.</p>

<p>In the cylinder shown in the engraving, the main
valve is down, so that steam is passing into the lower
end of the main cylinder. Two small ports can be seen
close to the piston-head 16, one above the other. The
upper port is open, and is the admission port; the lower
port, which is closed by the small piston, is for exhausting
the steam. The main piston 7 is on its upward
stroke, and the upper exhaust port seen above the piston-valve
15 is open, while the steam port immediately<span class="pagenum hide"><a id="Page_321"></a>321</span>
below it is closed by the valve-piston in the same way
that the exhaust port is closed at the other end. When
the main piston 7 shall reach near the top of its upward
stroke, the plate 10 will strike on the projection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>322</span>
on the reversing-rod, pushing up the slide-valve 13.
The upper edge of this slide-valve will cut the steam off
the passage <i>a</i>, and open the passage <i>b</i> to the exhaust.
This takes the steam away from the piston 20, and
allows piston 15 to move upward, closing the exhaust-port,
and opening the upper steam-port. The same
movement makes the piston 16 close its steam-port, and
open the exhaust. Piston 7 now begins to travel downward;
and, when it reaches nearly to the bottom of the
cylinder, the plate 10 catches the knob on the end of
the reversing-rod, and pulls down the slide-valve 13 to
the position it holds in the engraving. Steam then
rushes through the passage <i>a</i>, and makes the piston 20
push down the main valve. That completes the circle
of the operations in the steam cylinder.</p>

<h3>HOW THE AIR-END OPERATES.</h3>

<div id="i_33b" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 33em;">
  <img src="images/i_p321.png" width="516" height="611" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 33</span><i>b</i>.</div></div>

<p>The operation of the air part of the pump is very
simple. While the main piston (<a href="#i_33b">Fig. 33<i>b</i>)</a>, which is on
the same rod as the piston of the steam cylinder, is
moving upward, it is forcing the air out of the upper
end of the cylinder up under the discharge-valve 32,
and away through the proper passages to the main
reservoir. At the same time the lower end of the
cylinder is being filled with air drawn through the lower
receiving-valve 34. During the downward stroke of
the piston, the air will be delivered through the valve
33, and the upper part of the cylinder filled by air
received through the upper valve 34.</p>

<h3>AIR-PUMP DISORDERS.</h3>

<p>An engineer who does not understand the principles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>323</span>
of a locomotive’s action, is not likely to prove a valuable
runner. The men who are most successful in getting
trains over the road with solar regularity; the men who
make the best records on the mileage sheets for economy
in fuel and in lubricants; who are lightest in repairs, yet
keep their engine going longest,—are those who comprehend
the functions of every portion of the engine,
and what relation the various parts bear to each other.
With this knowledge clearly established in the mind of
the runner, his power to detect any thing wrong with
his engine becomes instinctive. Trifling defects, which
neglect would develop into serious disabilities, are rectified
in time, and the whole engine is maintained in
smooth working-order by the harmony of its individual
sections. The mere stopper and starter is losing his
hold on the locomotive service. When he drops off entirely,
our mileage for each dollar expended will be decidedly
increased.</p>

<p>The principles which apply to the running of a locomotive
are equally applicable to the management of an
air-brake, with all its perfected connections. This apparatus
can not be properly managed unless the man
who works it knows something about its action.</p>

<h3>PUNY DIFFICULTIES VANQUISH THE IGNORANT ENGINEER.</h3>

<p>A great many engineers who run passenger trains,
and take an intelligent interest in the working of the
locomotive, whose technicalities they have thoroughly
mastered, display no desire whatever to understand the
air-brake, and are perfectly contented with its action so
long as it will stop the train. The air-pump, so wonderfully
interesting to those who understand its movements,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>324</span>
receives no more attention than is necessary to
keep it going so that the required air-pressure is maintained.
They know how to start and stop the machine,
and they oil it regularly; but these are the limits of their
attentions. Should the pump happen to stop working,
the cause is mysterious, like many other mysteries; and
the natural remedy suggested, is to hit the thing on the
head with a monkey-wrench. Should it not respond to
this treatment by renewed action, the hand-brakes are
resorted to for the rest of the journey; and the round-house
foreman or machinist is required to do the head-work
which locates the trouble.</p>

<p>A belief prevails among men who labor principally
with their hands, that laziness is exclusively physical.
This is a mistake. It is a psychological fact, well known
to metaphysicians, that mental laziness is prevalent
enough to dwarf the minds of half the human race.
Men who would willingly work with their hands during
half their leisure time to keep their engines in proper
condition for running, have to be driven, by fear or
jealousy, before they will force their mental faculties to
do trifling labor in a new channel.</p>

<h3>CAUSES THAT MAKE BRAKES INOPERATIVE OFTEN EASILY
REMEDIED.</h3>

<p>Any engineer of ordinary intelligence, who will spend
one hour a day for two weeks studying up the Westinghouse
instruction book, will understand the brake so
well, from the pump to the hind end of the train, that
any imperfection happening to its working will be as
readily located as an ordinary defect in a locomotive.
Yet it is an intensely hard matter to induce men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>325</span>
running passenger engines to go through this trifling
mental exercise. The consequence is, that the brake
sometimes becomes inoperative from causes so slight
that men should be ashamed to report them; and they
would be so if they only comprehended how small a
mole-heap became their mountain. I knew a case where
all the train men—that is to say, engineer, fireman,
conductor, baggageman, and brakemen—wrestled for
twenty minutes over a triple valve, trying to find out
how to cut the air off a car; and, when the crowd was
vanquished, a colored porter came, and showed them how
the thing was done. This was on a road where straight
air was generally used. One day some winters ago, a
passenger train on the road I worked for was delayed
an hour or more at a station, waiting for something.
When the engineer tried to start the air-pump, it would
not work. He fumed and fussed over it for fifteen
minutes, gave it a liberal dose of copper hammer medicine,
and saturated it with oil, but all to no purpose. It
would not pump a pound of air, so the old-fashioned
Armstrong was called into operation. In the course of
its journey, this train had to pass the round-house at
headquarters; and the engineer stopped to see if his
pump could be given some quick remedy. I happened
to be the doctor consulted. On learning the particulars
of how the pump stopped working, I set fire to a piece
of greasy waste, and held the flame to the check-valve of
the air-drum; and the pump went right to work. All
the trouble was, that the check-valve was frozen in its
seat. I felt sorry for that engineer, he appeared to be
so thoroughly ashamed and crestfallen at being baffled
by such a small trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>326</span></p>

<h3>CARE OF THE AIR-PUMP.</h3>

<p>To run an air-pump successfully, the first requisite is
that it should be managed intelligently, and its wants
attended to regularly. An air-pump consists of numerous
moving parts, which should operate with the least
possible amount of friction: consequently, it is important
that the machine should be properly lubricated,—not
deluged with grease for ten minutes, and then run
on the interest of the excess for two hours, but sparingly
furnished with clean oil, which will keep the moving
parts moist all the time. To accomplish this, the
feeding-cup must be kept in proper working-order, so
that it will pass the oil regularly. I have found a leading
cause for air-pumps working unsatisfactorily to be in
the intermittent feeding of the oil-cups. Some dirt gets
into the cup, obstructing its action, and greater opening
is given to make it feed; then the oil goes through by
spasms, and the pump works irregularly; for at one time
the steam-piston is churning the oil, and again it is
working dry. There is also a common abuse of the oil-can
when any thing goes wrong with the pump; for
some men will then drench it with oil, expecting that to
make it work smoothly. Permanent injury is often
done in this way, especially where inferior oils are used,
which frequently contain mineral substances in suspension.
This solid matter is separated from the oil by the
heat, and settles in the small passages, filling them up
by degrees till eventually there is no channel left for
the steam to pass through to reverse the steam-valve;
so the pump stops. I once saw a runner trying to doctor
a sick pump by pouring the stickiest kind of gummy
valve-oil into an air-cylinder. He gave the thing its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>327</span>
quietus, as other poor doctors sometimes do with their
patients.</p>

<h3>PUMP PACKING.</h3>

<p>The stuffing-box packing is not generally supposed to
exercise an important effect on the action of an air-pump;
yet I have seen cases where irregular action of
the pump, and serious loss of air, resulted from bad
packing. Soapstone and asbestos, and other substances
that become compact and rigid when cold, are unsuitable
for packing the air end of a pump. After a little
use, material of this kind becomes so hard that no
amount of screwing of the gland will make it tight; and
the greater part of the air at that end of the pump escapes
through the stuffing-box instead of passing into
the drum.</p>

<h3>HOW STEAM PASSAGES GET CHOKED.</h3>

<p>Around the bushings of the cylinder, where the small
reversing piston 20 works, are diminutive steam passages,
very liable to get stopped up when foreign matter
is attempted to be run through the cylinder. Such
matter is occasionally introduced in various ways. When
rubber gaskets are used in the pipe connections leading
to the cylinder, the rubber often peels off in shreds, or
breaks off in small pieces, which lodge around the bushing
in the passages, producing harassing annoyance.
So soon as those passages get obstructed, or reduced
below their correct size, the pump begins to work badly.
Machinists not well versed in the mysterious ways of
air-pump disorders will now take that pump apart, and
find nothing the matter. Subsequent proceedings depend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>328</span>
upon the nature of the man who has the job in
hand. If the machinist be of a conservative disposition,
he will put the apparatus together again without making
any alteration, and perhaps will relieve his mind by expressing
a belief that the engineer does not know when
an air-pump is in good shape. Another machinist, of a
more enterprising stamp, must find something to change,
so he lengthens or shortens the reversing valve-rod 12
(a favorite resort of small-knowledge tinkers), which
gives the pump the <i>coup de grâce</i>; and it has to be overhauled
by a competent machinist before it again supplies
the air to stop a train. This competent man goes
direct to the root of the trouble. Skill in this particular
line of work convinces him, after an examination, that
the moving parts require no repairs; and knowledge begotten
of experience, supplemented by sound sense,
directs him where to look for the cause of defective
operation.</p>

<h3>SAGACITY NEEDED IN REPAIRING AIR-PUMPS.</h3>

<p>Men who meet with good success in repairing air-pumps,
and in determining, from the action of the pump,
the probable cause of defect, have to do a great deal of
deep and sagacious thinking. Sometimes a defect, simple
enough in itself, is extremely difficult to locate, because
it belongs to the unexpected order of occurrences.</p>

<p>Here was an instance. Some small jobs had been
done one day to the steam cylinder of a pump which had
not been working quite satisfactorily. When they tried
to start it, after being put together, the pump would
not work at all. The machinist who did the job, an
eminently competent man at such work, took the machine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>329</span>
apart again, but could detect no defect or maladjustment
about it. The steam cylinder, with all its
valves and rods and bushings, was critically examined:
the air-pump, with all its connections, got a thorough
inspection to no purpose. When an ordinary man goes
through the patient, thoughtful labor needed for an examination
of this kind, and finds nothing wrong, he is
apt to get discouraged, and confess himself beaten.
This man did not recognize the word beaten as applied
to his work. He reasoned, “This pump would work
if it were all right. It will not work, so something
must be wrong.” After exercising more patience and
perseverance, he discovered that the bushing 23 of the
reversing valve (usually called the kicking-rod valve) had
become loose, and, when the cap was screwed down, it
twisted the bushing round, and closed the passages that
lead steam to the reversing piston. There are small
grooves round the sides of the small steam passages to
provide for the bushings being moved a little, but these
grooves had become gummed up so that they failed to
serve their purpose of keeping the ports open.</p>

<h3>GRADUAL DEGENERATION OF THE AIR-PUMP.</h3>

<p>The working and stationary parts within the cylinders
of the air-pump are adjusted with nice exactness; and,
when they remain in their normal condition, the pump
works smoothly, and compresses air rapidly. When
wear, or any other cause, alters the dimensions of these
parts, the effect immediately becomes apparent in unsatisfactory
working of the whole machine. Rods are
adjusted so that valves or pistons shall cover and uncover
steam passages, and no superfluous movement is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>330</span>
provided for. The passages are so small that all the
steam they convey is needed for the work of reversing
the motion; and if from any cause the valve or piston
only partly uncovers the opening, the necessary volume
of steam does not get through. A close observer of the
pump’s action can, day by day, perceive the gradual degeneration
due to wear. Wear of the steam-cylinder
connections is generally indicated by reduced power.
The pump will not do its work satisfactorily, and has
difficulty in keeping up the pressure of air. This deterioration
continues till the pump will stop, unless its
decay gets arrested by repairs. When the valves of the
air-pump are in correct order for doing good work, the
discharge-valves 32 and 33 have 1/16″, and the suction-valves
34 ⅛″ lift. The continual tapping of these valves
on their seats has a tendency to wear out valves and
seats, making the lift greater than what is desirable.
Any material increase of lift for the discharge-valve has
a most injurious effect upon the motion of the pump, especially
if the suction-valve should happen to be leaky.
Then the movement of the pistons will become fluctuating,
and subject to frequent stoppages. The up-and-down
motion of the piston is of a jerky character, that
makes the beholder suppose the thing is uncertain which
way to go. Deterioration of air-valves is not, however,
the only cause for that jerky motion so often observed
in bad working pumps. A bent reversing valve stem
(kicker-rod) acts on the reversing valve with oblique
pull and thrust, which tend to move it away from the
seat, letting the steam pass the wrong way. A broken
main steam-valve ring has a similar effect; for the steam
passes to the wrong end of the valve, destroying its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>331</span>
equilibrium; and there is nothing decisive about its reversal,
or about its motion after it is reversed. Its action
resembles the movements of a vacillating human
being. It does not want to go in that direction, but
goes, then keeps trying to change its mind during the
rest of the journey. Obstructed steam passages will
sometimes cause indecisive action of the pump before it
gets bad enough to stop it altogether.</p>

<h3>CAUSES THAT MAKE A PUMP POUND.</h3>

<p>Pounding on the heads is a somewhat common attribute
of degenerated air-pumps. Broken or badly worn
air-valves very often cause the pump to pound. If the
trouble should happen to be in the upper air-valve, it
will demonstrate its disorder by causing pounding on
the upper head; and the lower valve’s malady will cause
pounding on the lower head. When a pump is suffering
from indecisive motion, or is pounding, and the
machinist does not feel certain about where the trouble
lies, he may safely examine the condition of the air-valves,—for
they can be easily reached,—and in a great
many cases the defect will be found there. Wear of
the pin whereon the bottom of the main valve-rod rests,
or of the rod itself, will induce pounding on the upper
head by the main piston. Some runners think, that, by
keeping the drain-cock of the steam-cylinder open all
the time, they secure dry steam. The practice is pernicious,
and injurious to the pump: for the piston receives
so little cushion when the drain-cock is shut, that
it can not afford the decrease made by a permanently
open cock; and consequently the loss of cushion permits
pounding on the lower head.</p>

<p>I have known of a disastrous effect being produced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>332</span>
on a pump by putting a new gasket, which proved too
thick, on the upper head. It was the thinnest copper
that could be found, but it perceptibly lengthened the
upper end of the cylinder so that the bottom knob on
the reversing stem struck the reversing plate on the
main piston before that action was due. On several
occasions I have had air-pumps reported to be working
badly, when all the trouble lay in the air-strainer being
partly choked up by floating vegetable matter that had
been sucked in with the air, and failed to pass through
the meshes. In another case we had much difficulty
in locating the defect, with a pump that absolutely
refused to work. The boiler-makers had been working
in the smoke-box, and by some means the end of the
exhaust-pipe got solidly stopped up with cinders. As
none of us had come across that particular cause of
obstruction before, we expended a good deal of labor
searching for the trouble before we thought to disconnect
the exhaust-pipe from the pump.</p>

<h3>THE TRIPLE VALVE.</h3>

<p>This is the part whose operation gives the brake its
automatic action. Those who have opposed this form
of brake have made great objection to the complicated
nature of the triple valve. But some familiarity with
the device shows that it is far from being complex,
considering the functions it performs. It is merely a
piston-valve carrying a slide-valve along with it.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the parts of the triple valve is
shown in <a href="#i_34">Fig. 34</a>.</p>

<div id="i_34" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 29em;">
  <img src="images/i_p333.png" width="458" height="775" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 34.</span></div></div>

<p>The triple valve has a piston 5, working in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>334</span>
chamber <i>B</i>, and carrying with it the slide-valve 6.
Air enters from the main pipe through the four-way
cock 13 into the drain-cup <i>A</i>, and passes to the chamber
<i>B</i>, forcing the piston up, and uncovering a small
feeding-groove in the upper part of the chamber, which
permits air to flow past the piston into the auxiliary
reservoir, while, at the same time, there is an open communication
from the brake-cylinder to the atmosphere
through the passages <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, and <i>g</i>. Air will continue
to flow into the auxiliary reservoir until it contains the
same pressure as the main brake-pipe.</p>

<h3>ACTION OF THE TRIPLE VALVE.</h3>

<p>To apply the brakes with their full force, the compressed
air in the main brake-pipe is permitted to escape,
when the greater pressure in the auxiliary reservoir
forces the piston 5 down below the feeding-groove,
thus preventing the return of air from the reservoir to
the brake-pipe. As the piston descends, it moves with
it the slide-valve 6, so as to permit air to flow directly
from the auxiliary reservoir into the brake-cylinder,
which forces the pistons out, and applies the brakes.
The brakes are released by again admitting pressure
into the main brake-pipe from the main reservoir; which
pressure, being greater than that of the auxiliary reservoir,
forces the piston 5 back to the position shown in
the engraving, recharges the reservoir, and at the same
time permits the air in the brake-cylinders to escape.</p>

<p>To apply the brakes gently, a slight reduction is
made in the pressure in the main brake-pipe, which
moves the piston down slowly until it is stopped by the
graduating spring 9. At this point, the opening <i>l</i> in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>335</span>
the slide-valve is opposite the port <i>f</i>, and allows air
from the auxiliary reservoir to feed through a hole in
the side of the slide-valve, and through the opening <i>l</i>
into the brake-cylinder. The passage <i>l</i> is opened and
closed by a small valve 7, which is attached to, and
moves with, the piston 5, provision being made for a
limited motion of these parts without moving the valve
6. When the pressure in the auxiliary reservoir has
been reduced by expanding into the brake-cylinder
until it is the same as the pressure in the main brake-pipe,
the graduating spring pushes the piston up until
the small valve 7 closes the feed opening <i>l</i>. This
causes whatever pressure is in the brake-cylinder to be
retained, thus applying the brake with a force proportionate
to the reduction of pressure in the brake-pipe.</p>

<h3>TO PREVENT CREEPING ON OF BRAKES.</h3>

<p>To prevent the application of the brakes, from a
slight reduction of pressure caused by leakage in the
brake-pipe, a semicircular groove is cut in the body of
the car-cylinder, 9/64 of an inch in width, 5/64 of an inch
in depth, and extending so that the piston must travel
three inches before the groove is covered by the packing
leather. A small quantity of air, such as results
from a leak, passing from the triple valve into the car-cylinder,
has the effect of moving the piston slightly
forward, but not sufficiently to close the groove, which
permits the air to flow out past the piston. If, however,
the brakes are applied in the usual manner,
the piston will be moved forward, notwithstanding the
slight leak, and will cover the groove. It is very important
that the groove shall be three inches long, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>336</span>
shall not exceed in area the dimensions given above.
Heretofore leakage valves have been used, and also a
leakage hole. These leakage holes have been found to
be too uncertain in their operation; and consequently
it is recommended that these holes should be closed, and
the grooves in the cylinders substituted, as rapidly as
possible.</p>

<p>When the handle of the four-way cock 13 is turned
down, there is a direct communication from main brake-pipe
to the brake-cylinder, the triple valve and auxiliary
reservoir being cut out; and the apparatus can be worked
as a non-automatic brake, by admitting air into the
main brake-pipe and brake-cylinder, to apply the brakes.
When from any cause it is desirable to have the brake
inoperative on any particular car, the four-way cock
is turned to an intermediate position, which shuts off
the brake-cylinder and reservoir, leaving the main
brake-pipe unobstructed to supply air to the remaining
vehicles.</p>

<p>The drain-cup <i>A</i> collects any moisture that may
accumulate, and is drained by unscrewing the bottom
nut.</p>

<h3>HOW TO APPLY AND RELEASE THE BRAKE.</h3>

<p>The brakes, as has been explained, are applied when
the pressure in the brake-pipe is suddenly reduced, and
released when the pressure is restored.</p>

<p>It is of very great importance that every engineer
should bear in mind that the air-pressure may sometimes
reduce slowly, owing to the steam-pressure getting
low, or from the stopping of the pump, or from a leakage
in some of the pipes when one or more cars are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>337</span>
detached for switching purposes, and that in consequence
it has been found absolutely necessary to provide
each cylinder with the leakage groove already
referred to, which permits a slight pressure to escape
without moving the piston, thus preventing the application
of the brakes, when the pressure is slowly
reduced, as would result from any of the above causes.</p>

<p>This provision against the accidental application of
the brakes must be taken into consideration, or else it
will sometimes happen that all of the brakes will not
be applied when such is the intention, simply because
the air has been discharged so slowly from the brake-pipe
that it only represents a considerable leakage, and
thus allows the air under some cars to be wasted.</p>

<p>It is thus very essential to discharge enough air in
the first instance, and with sufficient rapidity, to cause
all of the leakage grooves to be closed, which will remain
closed until the brakes have been released. In no
case should the reduction in the brake-pipe for closing
the leakage grooves be less than four or five pounds,
which will move all pistons out so that the brake-shoes
will be only slightly bearing against the wheels. After
this first reduction, the pressure can be reduced to suit
the circumstances.</p>

<p>On a long train, if the three-way cock be opened suddenly,
and then quickly closed, the pressure in the
brake-pipe, as indicated by the gauge, will be suddenly
and considerably reduced on the engine, and will then
be increased by the air-pressure coming from the rear
of the train: hence it is important to always close
the three-way cock slowly, and in such a manner that
the pressure, as indicated by the gauge, will not be increased;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>338</span>
or else the brakes on the engine and tender,
and sometimes on the first one or two cars, will come
off when they should remain on. It is likewise very
important, while the brakes are on, to keep the three-way
cock in such a position that the brake-pipe pressure
can not be increased by leakage from the main reservoir;
for any increase of pressure in the brake-pipe causes the
brakes to come off.</p>

<p>On long down grades, it is important to be able to
control the speed of the train, and at the same time
to maintain a good working pressure. This is easily
accomplished by running the pump at a good speed, so
that the main reservoir will accumulate a high pressure
while the brakes are on. When, after using the brake
some time, the pressure has been reduced to sixty
pounds, the train pipes and reservoirs should be recharged
as much as possible before the speed has increased
to the maximum allowed. A greater time for
recharging is obtained by considerably reducing the
speed of the train just before recharging, and by taking
advantage of the variation in the grades.</p>

<p>There should not be any safety-valve or leaks in the
main reservoir, otherwise the necessary surplus pressure
for quickly recharging can not be obtained.</p>

<p>To release the brakes with certainty, it is important
to have a higher pressure in the main reservoir than in
the main pipe. If an engineer feels that some of his
brakes are not off, it is best to turn the handle of the
three-way cock just far enough to shut off the main
reservoir, and then pump up fifteen or twenty pounds
extra, which will insure the release of all of the brakes;
all of which can be done while the train is in motion.</p>

<p>For ordinary stops, great economy in the use of air is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>339</span>
effected by, in the first instance, letting out from eight
to twelve pounds pressure while the train is at speed,
taking care to begin a sufficient distance from the
station.</p>

<h3>PUMP GOVERNOR.</h3>

<p>This is an important attachment which ought to be
connected to all air-brake pumps. It not only prevents
the carrying of an excessive air-pressure by the engineers,
which often results in the sliding of the wheels,
but it also causes the accumulation of a surplus of air-pressure
in the main reservoir, while the brakes are
applied, which insures the release of the brakes without
delay. It also limits the speed of the pump, and
consequently the wear.</p>

<div id="i_34b" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 26em;">
  <img src="images/i_p340a.png" width="407" height="757" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 34</span><i>b</i>.</div></div>

<p>The pump governor is shown in <a href="#i_34b">Fig. 34<i>b</i></a>, the object
of which is to automatically cut off the supply of steam
to the pump when the air-pressure in the train-pipe
exceeds a certain limit, say seventy pounds.</p>

<p>The operation of this governor is as follows: the
wheel 8 is screwed down so as to permit the valve 10
to be unseated by the excess of pressure on the upper
side of the valve, permitting steam to pass through the
openings <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> to the pump. A connection is made
from the train-pipe to the upper end of the governor,
and the compressed air passes around the stem 14 to
the upper side of the diaphragm plate 18, which is held
to its position by the spring 16, which latter is of sufficient
strength to resist a pressure of, say, seventy
pounds per square inch on diaphragm. As soon as the
air-pressure on the diaphragm 18 exceeds this amount,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>340</span>
it forces the diaphragm down, unseating the valve 13,
and allowing the steam on the upper side of the valve
10 to escape through the exhaust 6, which causes an
excess of steam-pressure on the lower side of the valve
10, forcing the valve against its seat, and cutting off
the supply of steam to the pump.</p>

<p>When the pressure in the train-pipe is diminished by
applying the brakes, the diaphragm is restored to the
position shown by the action of the spring 16. The
valve 13 is seated by the spring 12; and the steam-pressure,
passing through the port <i>C</i>, accumulates on
the upper side of the valve 10, forcing it down, and
opening the passage for steam to the pump until the
air-pressure is again restored to the required limit of
seventy pounds.</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>THE EAMES VACUUM BRAKE.</i></span>
</h2>
</div>

<h3>OPERATION OF THE BRAKE.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> Vacuum Brake, as the name implies, is operated
by means of a vacuum which is formed in the connections
that act the part of the cylinder in the air-brake.
With an air-brake, compressed air is made to do the
work of applying the brakes by moving a piston to which
the brake-lever is attached, the air being carried throughout
the train by means of iron pipes and rubber hose:
with the vacuum brake the work is done in a similar
way with similar connections; but, instead of compressed
air being forced inside the pipes and apparatus,
all the air is exhausted out, and the natural pressure of
the atmosphere is made to do the work.</p>

<h3>THE DIAPHRAGM.</h3>

<div id="i_35" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <img src="images/i_p342.png" width="466" height="343" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 35.</span></div></div>

<p>Under each vehicle of a train, as seen in <a href="#i_35">Fig. 35</a>, a
diaphragm is securely fastened which performs the combined
duties of cylinder and piston. It consists of a
kettle-shaped casting with a loose disk of heavy rubbered
duck fastened over its mouth; the center of the
disk being provided with an iron plate, through which
passes an eye-bolt for forming connection with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>342</span>
brake-lever. The inside of the diaphragm is connected
to the pipe which passes along the train, and has its
front end connected with the ejector on the locomotive.</p>

<h3>THE EJECTOR.</h3>

<div id="i_36" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 26em;">
  <img src="images/i_p343.png" width="401" height="698" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 36.</span></div></div>

<p>The position of the ejector in the cut can be clearly
seen in <a href="#i_36">Fig. 36</a>, where there is also a diaphragm to be
seen under the deck where it is located when used to
operate driver brakes. The ejector is operated on the
same principle as the water injector, only it is used to
lift air instead of water. A cross-section of the injector
is shown in <a href="#i_36">Fig. 36</a>. When the engineer wishes
to apply the brake, he pulls the handle 41 (broken off in
the cut), which opens the valve <i>B49</i>, and admits steam to
the body of the ejector <i>A1</i>. The steam rushes upward
round the end of the tube 5, its velocity being accelerated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>344</span>
in passing through the contracted opening left
round the top of the tube. Passing through tubes 3 and
6, the steam shoots up in the form of a column with a
hollow base; the tube 5, which is connected with the
pipes and diaphragms on the train, forming this base.
The effect of the steam passing out under these conditions
is to induce a current through the tube 5, which
draws up the valve <i>B7</i>, and sucks the air out of the
pipes and diaphragms. A vacuum being thus formed
in the diaphragms, the atmosphere presses the flexible
ends together. This tendency to collapse is retarded
by the brake-rod connections, and the latter receive a
pull equal to the combined atmospheric pressure on the
diaphragm. The brake-levers are arranged to transmit
a proper tension to the brake-shoes for making the
brake effective. A vacuum gauge placed on the front
of the ejector enables the engineer to regulate the
power as he wants it. The brake is released by pushing
on the lever 24, which opens the valve 8, and
admits air into the brake-pipes. The release-valve attachment
is sidewise in vertical section cut through the
handle, and is put separate for convenience of illustration.</p>

<h3>CARE OF THE BRAKE.</h3>

<p>The valve <i>B7</i> of the ejector needs grinding occasionally;
and, if the lift should be too great, the valve will
hammer the seat out of shape. Sometimes when waste
or other fibrous impurities are sucked through the pipe,
they stick in this valve, keeping it away from the seat.
The valve is very easily reached by taking off the cap
<i>O4</i>. The steam-valve <i>B49</i> needs about the same care<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>345</span>
as any other steam-valve, and its troubles are of the
same nature. The shoulder at the top of the tube 5,
which is used to obstruct the steam, thereby increasing
the velocity of the quantity that passes, sometimes gets
cut into channels with the fast moving steam striking
it. This reduces the promptness of the ejector’s action,
but it is a form of deterioration that proceeds very
slowly. Care must be taken to keep the drip-valves <i>A</i>
and <i>B16</i> in order, otherwise there may be trouble with
the ejector throwing water, or freezing up if the engine
stands where that apparatus will get cold in winter.</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>POWER OF LOCOMOTIVES AND TRAIN RESISTANCES.</i></span>
</h2>
</div>

<h3>CALCULATING POWER OF LOCOMOTIVES.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> capacity of engines is generally expressed in
horse-power, which is a measurable quantity; but, for
several reasons, that method of indicating power has
not been usually applied to the locomotive. When practical
railroad men hear the size of cylinders, the diameter
of driving-wheels, and the boiler dimensions of a locomotive,
mentioned, they understand what kind of service
the engine is adapted for, and about the weight of train
it can haul. As it has been found necessary for designing
and other purposes, to estimate, with some degree
of accuracy, the work a locomotive is capable of doing,
it has become usual to reckon the power of a locomotive
by the tractive force it can exert upon the rails.</p>

<h3>PROPORTION OF ADHESION TO TRACTION.</h3>

<p>Tractive force is the power which the pistons of the
engine are capable of exerting through the driving-wheels,
to move the engine and train. The efficiency
of the engine’s traction is dependent upon the adhesion
of the wheels to the rails; for, where the adhesion is
insufficient, the pistons will slip the wheels, and no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>347</span>
useful effect will result. To prevent the wheels of
ordinary American engines from slipping on dry rails,
the weight resting on the drivers must be about five
times the power exerted by the pistons to slip the
wheels. To prevent slipping on wet, unwashed rails,
more than double the above weight would be needed.
In practice, locomotives are not provided with weight
enough to prevent the wheels from slipping on a greasy
rail: the sand-boxes provide the means of obtaining
adhesion where the rails are in bad order. A common
practice is to place upon the drivers weight equal to
about six times the power exerted to slip the wheels,
which leaves a small margin for wet rails. Many locomotives
have power sufficient to slip the wheels on dry
rails; but such engines generally have boilers too small
for the cylinders, or the distribution of weight on the
drivers is badly effected.</p>

<h3>ESTIMATING TRACTIVE POWER.</h3>

<p>The easiest way of calculating the tractive power of
a locomotive is by use of the following simple formula,
first propounded by <span class="locked">Pambour:—</span></p>

<p class="p1 b1 center">
<i>d<sup>2</sup>Lp</i><br />
<i>T</i> = —————.<br />
<i>D</i>
</p>

<div class="blockquot hang b1">

<p><i>d</i> = the diameter of the cylinder in inches.</p>

<p><i>L</i> = the length of the stroke in inches.</p>

<p><i>D</i> = the diameter of driving-wheels in inches.</p>

<p><i>p</i> = the effective mean pressure on the piston in
pounds per square inch.</p>

<p><i>T</i> = the equivalent tractive force at the rails in
pounds.</p></div>

<p>This, given in plain terms, reads: Square the diameter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>348</span>
of piston in inches; multiply by the length of stroke
in inches; multiply by the mean pressure of steam per
square inch, and divide by the diameter of the drivers
in inches.</p>

<p>We will apply the calculations to the case of the
standard Buchanan passenger engine; the cylinders
being 17 by 24 inches, the drivers 68 inches in diameter,
and the effective pressure on pistons about 80
pounds. The problem is worked <span class="locked">thus:—</span></p>

<p>This gives 8,160 pounds as the pressure exerted to
turn the drivers, which may be accepted as a close approximation
to the truth. In using this formula, the
mistake has frequently been made of taking the quotient
to represent the power developed by one cylinder,
when, in fact, it gives the power of both.</p>

<p>A method of calculating the locomotive traction that
is a good deal followed by our engineers, is to ascertain
the foot-pounds of work the engine is doing during each
revolution of the drivers. By dividing the total thus
found by the circumference of the drivers in feet, the
force exerted through each foot that the engine moves
is found. Taking the same engine, the pistons 17 inches<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>349</span>
diameter, give 226.98 square inches area. This is multiplied
by the mean effective pressure of steam, giving
226.98 × 80 = 18158.4 pounds pressing on each piston
through the whole stroke of four feet.</p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>These figures show that 145267.2 foot-pounds are exerted
during each turn of the wheel, whose circumference
is 17.8024; therefore, 145267 ÷ 17.8024 = 8160,
the number of pounds exerted through each foot moved.</p>

<p>There is still another way of figuring out tractive
power by calculating the rotational force and the leverage
through which it is applied to the locomotive
wheels. The pressure of steam on the piston is productive
of two strains on the crank-axle. When the
crank is on the dead center, the pressure upon the
crank-pin forces the axle against the axle-box without
causing any tendency to rotate: but, when the crank-pin
is on the quarter, the full leverage of the crank is available
for rotation; the leverage increasing gradually as
the crank gets away from the center. The mean effort
upon the crank-pin during one revolution of the crank
is to the effort of the piston as .6366 is to 1.</p>

<p>Now, to find the traction of the locomotive, we multiply
the length of our crank, which is 12 inches, by
.6366, which gives 7.64 as the length of the crank receiving
constant pressure from the pistons. The aggregate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>350</span>
steam-pressure has already been found to be for
each piston, 18158.4 pounds. This is multiplied by
7.64; and the product is divided by the radius of the
wheel, which is 34 inches, giving as a quotient 4080,
being the power exerted on one side of the engine.
That, multiplied by 2, gives 8160 pounds,—the same
as was found by the other two methods.</p>

<h3>HORSE-POWER OF LOCOMOTIVES.</h3>

<p>When people wish to find the horse-power developed
by a locomotive, the indicator is generally employed,
and the calculations made from the diagram. Others
figure out locomotive horse-power as they do that of
other engines. By this method, the engine whose traction
we have been investigating might have the horse-power
calculated as <span class="locked">follows:—</span></p>

<p>No allowance has been made for frictional losses in
any of these calculations.</p>

<p>One horse-power is equivalent to the work performed
in raising 33,000 pounds one foot high in one minute.
One pound raised 33,000 feet high, or 330 pounds raised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>351</span>
100 feet high, would amount to the same thing. One
horse-power is usually spoken of as 33,000 foot-pounds;
and engineers in this country always calculate work by
foot-pounds,—that is, so many pounds raised a certain
number of feet. To indicate the capacity of any prime
motor, the foot-pounds of work it is capable of raising
in a given time must be stated. Although the work is
often done without any thing being raised vertically,
the power represented would be capable of raising the
equivalent weight in the stated time.</p>

<h3>FORMULAS OF TRAIN RESISTANCES.</h3>

<p>The work which a locomotive performs in pulling a
train is expended in overcoming the resistances due to
wheel-friction, gradients, curves, and atmospheric or
wind pressure. Formulas have been propounded for
calculating all train resistances, but they are utterly
untrustworthy for American railroad trains. The best
known formula of this kind is that given by D. K. Clark
in his <i>Railway Machinery</i>. One calculation will show
how misleading its figures are when applied to American
railroad train resistances. Figured by the Clark
formula, the total resistance per ton of a passenger
train running at a speed of fifty miles an hour on a
straight level track, is 22.6 pounds. By accurate records
with his dynagraph car, Professor P. H. Dudley
found the total resistances of an express train running
at a speed of fifty-one miles an hour, to be 11 pounds.
The resistances are so much different under different
conditions, that nothing closer than a loose approximation
can be calculated of the work done by a locomotive,
unless indicator or dynamometer tests are made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>352</span></p>

<h3>EXPERIMENTS OF TRAIN RESISTANCES ON THE ERIE RAILWAY.</h3>

<p>In experiments made with a freight train on the Erie
Railway in 1881, reported by Mr. F. M. Wilder to the
Railway Master Mechanics’ Association, it was found
that the total resistance on a level track was from 3.25
to 4.5 pounds per ton at speeds under twenty miles an
hour. These figures will approximately represent the
resistance due to wheel and axial friction in summer;
but this resistance will be higher during cold weather,
when the oil in the axle-boxes gets frozen. Track in
bad condition will also tend to increase the wheel resistance,
and improperly constructed trucks and wheels will
entail the use of more power to move the train. Where
trucks are so defective that they do not maintain the
wheels revolving in parallel planes, the flanges of some
of the wheels will rub on the rail, increasing the resistance.
Wheels out of round; those having the axle out
of center, however slight; wheels of different size on the
same axle; and numerous other car-truck disorders,—all
contribute their share in making a train pull hard.</p>

<h3>CONDITIONS THAT INCREASE TRAIN RESISTANCES.</h3>

<p>In a calm day the atmospheric resistance is very slight
under a speed of twenty miles an hour. To a fast train,
atmospheric resistance becomes an important obstruction.
The atmosphere acts on the train in various ways,
that are hard to calculate with any degree of accuracy,—head
resistance to the locomotive, which is presumably
equal to the exposed area of the front of the engine and
cab in square feet multiplied by the air-pressure due
to the speed; then, various parts of the cars present
surfaces that the air strikes against, and increases the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>353</span>
resistance; the raised and projecting roofs of passenger
coaches offer an ample area for the wind to hold the
train by; and every opening between the cars permits
the wind to obstruct, to some extent, each individual
car. Where wind is blowing freely in a direction to
strike the train on the side, the resistance is greatly
increased; the retardation being due to the wind pushing
the car sidewise, so that the wheel-flanges rub
against the rail, and also to the wind obtaining a strong
hold on the front of each car. In the case of a freight
train, the resistance is greatly increased when the doors
of cars are left open; for every car in that condition acts
like a parachute to reduce speed. Freight trains arranged
with box cars and flat cars mixed, obtain more
than a fair share of obstruction from the atmosphere;
for every box car that has a space opened in front by a
flat car, gets nearly the full pressure of the wind in its
front. It pays in coal to incur some trouble and delay
in putting box cars together. That also enables the
brakemen to get along the train more rapidly than
where the cars are mixed.</p>

<p>In the experiments already alluded to on the Erie
Railway, it was found, in the absence of wind, that the
first car of a freight-train produced atmospheric resistance
equal to a surface of sixty-three feet, multiplied
by the air-pressure due to speed; and that each subsequent
car offered a resistance of twenty per cent of
that due to the first car.</p>

<h3>RESISTANCE OF CURVES.</h3>

<p>Curved track increases the resistance of trains in
direct proportion to the shortness of curvature. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>354</span>
European railways, the character of the curves is nearly
always denominated by the length of radius: in this
country, a railroad curve is described as of so many degrees.
The degree of a curve is determined by the
angle subtended at its center by a chord of 100 feet.
To those who think of a curve by its radius, it may be
well to explain that a curve of one degree has a radius
of 5,370 feet, and the radius of any curve can be ascertained
by dividing these figures by the number of
degrees.</p>

<h3>WORK DONE BY A LOCOMOTIVE PULLING A TRAIN.</h3>

<p>To pull a train up an ascending gradient, the locomotive
has to perform work similar to the operation of a
pile-driving engine in raising its driving-block. The
train is the block raised by the locomotive; and the lift
is not vertical, but up an inclined plane; yet the amount
of work done is reckoned in precisely the same way.
When the engine of a pile-driver raises a block weighing
1,000 pounds a distance of 30 feet, the work done is
1,000 × 30 = 30,000 foot-pounds: when a locomotive
pulls a train weighing 1,000 tons over one mile rising
30 feet, the engine performs 30,000 foot-tons of work in
that distance by raising the load alone. The total
amount of work done will also include the energy expended
in overcoming wheel-friction and other ordinary
train resistances.</p>

<p>To find the tractive force which the engine must
exert through each foot of the mile traversed in pulling
the train described, we must divide the foot-pounds of
work done, by the distance over which the power was exerted.
Thirty thousand foot-tons of work is 60,000,000<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>355</span>
foot-pounds. To this we will add 5 pounds additional for
every ton of the train for every foot advanced to cover
wheel and wind resistances, making 86,400,000 foot-pounds
of work that the engine has to perform in hauling
the train one mile. This, divided by the number of feet in
a mile, will give 16,363 pounds as the work the locomotive
must perform through each foot,—an effort which is entirely
within the capacity of many consolidation engines.</p>

<h3>RECORD OF FAST EXPRESS TRAIN MADE BY PROFESSOR P. H.
DUDLEY’S DYNAGRAPH CAR.</h3>

<p>Engineers interested in finding an approximation of
the work done in taking a fast train over a railroad, can
make a close estimate by studying out the figures given
below by Professor Dudley. The table shows the performance
of an ordinary locomotive upon a train composed
of three eight-wheel and six twelve-wheel cars;
weight 250 tons; working-weight of engine and tender,
126,000 pounds; cylinders of engine, 17 by 24 inches;
diameter of drivers, 72 inches; weight on drivers, 48,000
pounds; blowing-pressure on boiler, 135 pounds.</p>

<p>In starting the train, the locomotive would record a
tension of 11,000 to 12,000 pounds for one or two hundred
feet of distance. After hooking up, the tension
would decrease to about 2,800 or 3,000 pounds; and,
with this pull, the speed of 50 miles an hour was attained
in the fifth mile. As the speed increases, the resistance
of the air against the locomotive becomes greater,
and more of its own power is required to move itself.
In starting a train, the working adhesion of the steel-tired
drivers on dry steel rails is about 33 per cent of the
weight upon them, and reduces as the speed increases.</p>

<h3>HOW WATER GETS MIXED WITH LIME.</h3>

<p><span class="firstword">Throughout</span> a very wide area of territory in the
United States and Canada, limestones, or various forms
of calcareous rocks, constitute the upper rock stratum
immediately underlying the subsoil of the great agricultural
regions. During the stupendous operations of
Nature in building up this continent, the rocks have
been subjected to vast disintegrating agencies: they
have been torn and eroded by huge masses of ice;
they have been burned by the rays of the unshadowed
sun; fractured by the congealing power resulting from
deep-searching frost; melted by water,—that most universal
solvent in nature; then scattered far and wide
by ice and flood. This process has been so complete,
that, in the whole limestone territory, all the earth seems
charged with lime. Limestones are very sparingly soluble
in pure water; but the rain that falls from the clouds
is not pure, but contains a charge of carbonic acid that
acts chemically upon the lime, forming salts, which the
water readily dissolves. Owing to this circumstance,
there are few streams, and fewer wells, in the calcareous
districts that are not contaminated with lime. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>360</span>
water that passes into streams, generally runs over surfaces
that have been washed partly free from lime; and,
in consequence of this, creeks and rivers are not so
badly tainted with lime-salts as the water in wells that
stands saturating the rocks. The appearance or taste
of water gives no indication of the quantity of lime
held in solution; for the ice-cold well, or sparkling
spring, that supplies water so pleasant to drink, may
yield so much lime-salts that the water would be ruinous
to sheets and flues when used for boiler purposes.</p>

<h3>EXPENSE ENTAILED BY USING BAD WATER.</h3>

<p>Considering the financial influence of the matter
alone, it might be supposed that parties building railroads
would exercise diligence in selecting the best
water that possibly could be secured for boiler purposes,
since the operating expenses are largely magnified by
using impure water; but for many years the subject
appeared to receive no attention whatever from those
best able to regulate the water supply, and water stations
were established without any consideration as to
the character of the water available.</p>

<p>It is owing to the absence of care in the original
locating of water stations, that numerous tanks are
to-day drawing their supply from bad wells, where surface
water could easily be obtained. Railroad companies
are peculiarly conservative about making changes
that entail expenditure of money: and existing evils in
the water supply arrangements are often continued, because
some expense would be incurred in making them;
although no kind of money expenditure would bring a
more ample return in economy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>361</span></p>

<h3>EFFORTS OF MASTER MECHANICS TO SECURE GOOD WATER.</h3>

<p>The paramount importance of the quality of water
used in locomotive boilers, has been long recognized by
nearly all master mechanics; for the effect of bad water
is brought to their attention in an unmistakable manner.
The subject has been frequently before the Master
Mechanics’ Association for investigation. A report
of a committee appointed at an early meeting to investigate
the subject, declares that “Master mechanics have
had the conviction forced home, that impure water
is the bane of good boilers;” and, even then, a vigorous
effort was being made to eliminate the injurious ingredients
from the water; and the work was carried on
in a hopeful and confident spirit, which was indicated
by the words of a subsequent report, which asserted
that “Different waters differ widely in the component
parts of the impurities they contain, and each requires
separate study and treatment;” but the committee were
satisfied that the engineering and mechanical skill of
railway men could readily devise a suitable appliance
for each particular case. In those days, railroad men
thought that they could, by mechanical and chemical
means, purify bad water, and render it suitable for boiler
use. Purifying bad water proved about as difficult an
undertaking as reforming the average bad man is recognized
to be; and few railroad men can now be found
who believe a purifying process can be successfully
performed on the large quantity of water needed for
locomotive boiler feeding.</p>

<h3>LOSS OF FAITH IN PURIFYING METHODS.</h3>

<p>The conclusion that artificial methods of purifying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>362</span>
bad water can not be carried out in railroad water supply,
was not arrived at hastily. It was reached by slow
degrees, and through the convincing ordeal of many disappointments,
with methods and nostrums that promised
to effect the desired results.</p>

<p>Experience demonstrated, that, in the limestone
regions, the proper and only way to avoid trouble from
lime incrustation in locomotive boilers, is to obtain
soft water from streams, or by collecting the rainfall in
ponds or reservoirs.</p>

<h3>SCALE-MAKING AGENCIES.</h3>

<p>Water, as has been mentioned, is the most universal
solvent in nature; and what is known as hard water
contains many foreign ingredients, but those that exercise
such a pernicious influence upon locomotive boilers
are lime and magnesia. The scale-making lime appears
in two forms,—sulphate of lime, and carbonate of lime.
The former is the more dangerous and troublesome
scale-making agent; the latter is most frequently met
with.</p>

<p>Ordinary well-water will be found to contain solid
matter in solution varying from 10 to 100 grains to the
gallon. Under 20 grains to the gallon of impurities
may be considered fair water if the principal ingredient
is carbonate of lime, but that amount of sulphate will
make highly objectionable boiler water. Where the use
of well-water is unavoidable on a road, quite a saving to
boilers can be effected by ascertaining the quantity and
character of the impurities received from each water-tank,
and directing the engineers to avoid those that
contain the worst scale formers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>363</span></p>

<h3>TO ASCERTAIN THE QUALITY OF WATER.</h3>

<p>The proper way to ascertain with accuracy the character
of water, is to send specimens to a competent
analytical chemist for quantitative analysis. But, as few
railroad companies will incur the expense of having
the water of the water stations systematically tested,
master mechanics may, by a little labor, study, and practice,
learn to make tests for themselves that will indicate
near enough for practical purposes the character
of each water station supply.</p>

<p>As master mechanics are the railroad officials most
directly interested in the kind of water supplied for
locomotive use, they ought to have direct control of
all the water stations on the roads where they are in
charge.</p>

<h3>APPLIANCES NEEDED IN TESTING WATER.</h3>

<p>The chemical apparatus needed for the examination
of well-water are, a balance that will weigh accurately
to half a grain; an oil stove for evaporative purposes; a
few pint porcelain evaporating dishes; a sand-bath,
which can be made from a piece of sheet-copper; a
dozen test tubes; half a dozen vials to hold solutions of
chemically pure chemicals; some pieces of glass tubing;
a small mortar and pestle; a supply of filtering-paper;
and the vessels needed for measuring accurately. For
the solution of the chemical re-agents to be used, a supply
of distilled water is necessary; and water of this
kind is also necessary to make comparisons with. A
piece of pure crystalline ice, when melted, will generally
produce water pure enough for experimental purposes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>364</span></p>

<h3>PREPARING FOR THE EXPERIMENTS.</h3>

<p>In bringing in water for examination, it is best to
have it drawn from the water-tank into a perfectly clean
jug, which should be corked and labeled. Weigh an
evaporating dish, noting down the exact weight, and on
a sand-bath evaporate one quart or half a gallon of the
water to be inspected. When the dish becomes dry,
rub off all dust that may be adhering to the bottom, and
weigh the dish. The added weight will indicate approximately
the total amount of solid matter in the
water. Note that down, and every other detail of the
experiments.</p>

<h3>LIME HELD IN SOLUTION BY FREE CARBONIC ACID.</h3>

<p>Sometimes a large quantity of bicarbonate of lime is
held in solution by free carbonic acid, which escapes as
soon as the water is boiled, leaving the lime to subside
in the form of mud. Water of this kind may appear
very hard, yet not be very objectionable for boiler use;
since the deposit can be blown out if the blow-off cock
is used freely. To test this, boil a pint of water for two
or three minutes in a perfectly clean dish, then pass it
through a filter paper that has been previously dried
and weighed. When the operation is finished, dry and
weigh the filter paper again; and the added weight will
indicate the amount of solid matter held in solution by
free carbonic acid gas.</p>

<h3>TEST FOR LIME SALTS.</h3>

<p>Superficial tests that will indicate the condition of
the water from the coloring produced by the impurities
combining with chemicals that take them out of solution,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>365</span>
can be made in the following manner: Five test
tubes are half filled with water to be tested. The first
one will be examined for lime in any form. A teaspoonful
of aqua ammonia is put in the water for the purpose
of stimulating the chemical action, then twenty drops
of a solution of oxalate of ammonia are added. The
degree of turbidity will indicate the quantity of lime in
the water. Should the quantity of lime be very small,
the test tube would have to be kept in a warm place a
few hours before the re-action showed itself.</p>

<h3>TEST FOR SULPHATE OF LIME.</h3>

<p>The water in the second test tube will be examined
for sulphate of lime. A few drops of hydrochloric acid
are first put into the water, then twenty drops of chloride
of barium. A white precipitate, which generally
makes its appearance at once, indicates the presence of
sulphuric acid. In water belonging to the calcareous
regions, it may safely be concluded that the sulphuric
acid is held in the form of sulphate of lime. An exception
has sometimes to be made for water drawn from
the vicinity of coal mines, and such places, where sulphate
of iron abounds. Water that holds sulphuric acid
in this form is readily identified by a test for iron salts.</p>

<p>When it is found that water gives a strong re-action
indicating sulphate of lime, the inference may safely be
drawn that the tank it came from should be avoided.</p>

<h3>TEST FOR CARBONATE OF MAGNESIA.</h3>

<p>The third test tube may be examined for carbonate of
magnesia, which is found freely mixed with the water
of many wells. Put aqua ammonia in this tube, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>366</span>
add twenty drops of a solution of phosphate of soda. A
crystalline precipitate will indicate the presence of magnesium.
Where carbonate of magnesia is present in
considerable quantities in water, it sometimes forms
along with lime a thick, porous scale; and in other cases
it is apt to float on the top of the water, causing trouble
by making the boiler foam. If an engine boiler has got
scale formed from water free from magnesia, and goes
on to a division where this impurity abounds, the magnesia
will take off the old scale before it begins to form
new incrustation. A few pounds of common salt put
into the tender daily will have a good effect in preventing
trouble with magnesia; since it forms chloride of
magnesia, which is a decided preventive of lime scale.</p>

<h3>TEST FOR SALTS OF IRON.</h3>

<p>In the fourth test tube we will search for iron salts.
A solution of potassa or ammonia will produce, should
iron be present, a whitish precipitate, which presently
turns to a dirty green, and, ultimately, a reddish-brown
color, owing to its absorption of oxygen from the air.
A more delicate test for iron is ferro-cyanide of potassium,
or sulpho-cyanate of potassium; but other mineral
combinations might deceive a novice using these reagents
into the belief that iron was present when it
was not. A light trace of iron in water is very common;
and, so long as it is in minute quantities, the salt
seems quite innocent. But occasionally water is found
saturated with iron in the form known by chemists as
<i>FeSO<sub>4</sub></i>. Then it is very objectionable for boiler-feeding;
since it exercises a strong corrosive action on the
plates, pitting and furrowing being a common result of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>367</span>
its action. Scale formed by water of this character is
nearly always a hard, thin substance, that sticks with
intense tenacity, and generally takes away part of the
skin of the iron when it is taken off.</p>

<h3>TEST FOR CHLORINE.</h3>

<p>The fifth tube we will examine for common salt,
which is nearly always present in water. This test is
done by dropping in some nitrate of silver solution,
which produces a white precipitate, caused by the silver
combining with the chlorine, which is the principal element
in common salt. This is an excessively fine test,
and the nitrate of silver will detect an incredibly small
trace of common salt in water. The worst effect that
common salt has in water, is to cause priming. Where
it is present to any great extent, the blow-off cock
should be used frequently on the road; and a surface-cock
is quite an aid in keeping the boiler in order.
Water that is taken from wells or streams about cities,
and found to give strong chlorine re-actions, is nearly
always contaminated with sewage.</p>

<h3>LEARNING THE MANIPULATION OF TESTS.</h3>

<p>Practice in making superficial qualitative tests of
water, produces skill in reading the meaning of the
various chemical re-actions. This skill can be rapidly
developed by practice on prepared specimens. Water
for experiments on carbonate of lime can be prepared
by dissolving calcite crystals or marble dust in hydrochloric
acid, or by mixing chalk with clean rain-water,
and filtering it till free from turbidity. While the chalk
is mixed with the water, and unfiltered, the specimen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>368</span>
will be made stronger by blowing air from the lungs
through a glass tube into the water. A preparation for
testing sulphate of lime may be made by dissolving some
gypsum in distilled water. Fluid magnesia, dropped
into pure water, will provide carbonate of magnesia
specimens; and Epsom salts will give the magnesia re-action,
with the addition that it will indicate sulphuric
acid under the chloride of barium test. A grain of salt
no larger than a pin-head dropped into a pint of distilled
water, will give a distinct chlorine test when nitrate of
silver solution is added. Stronger, or even weaker, salt
solution can be used by the experimenter while he is
working into practice. A small piece of sulphate of
iron, dissolved in water, will provide a test for iron.</p>

<h3>MAKING QUALITATIVE TESTS.</h3>

<p>While pursuing the apprentice practice of tests with
these solutions, care must be taken to have the test
tubes perfectly clean. Go over the tests in something
like the following order. The carbonate of lime test is
to be made first. Four test tubes will be used. In the
first we put distilled water alone; in the second we put
ten drops of the chalk solution; in the third we put
twenty drops of the solution; in the fourth we put thirty
drops, then add distilled water till all the test tubes are
about two-thirds filled. Drop into each tube about the
same quantity of oxalate of ammonia solution, and the
degree of turbidity will help to indicate the hardness of
each specimen. The first tube, containing pure water,
will give no re-action if the chemicals are pure.</p>

<p>This process should be extended to all the other solutions,
and will be found very helpful. In carrying out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>369</span>
experiments of this kind, much assistance will be obtained
from having a work like Stuckhardt’s <i>Chemistry</i>
at hand for reference.</p>

<h3>THE SOAP-TEST FOR HARDNESS.</h3>

<p>Most people are aware that hard water has a peculiar
effect upon soap, making it curdle instead of lather
when used for washing purposes. This peculiarity was
made use of some years ago by Dr. Clark of Aberdeen,
Scotland, in devising a test for the hardness of water,
in which the quantity of a standard soap solution needed
to produce a permanent lather on water, indicated the
degree of hardness of the water. A modification of
the Clark process can be used very conveniently by
master mechanics in making superficial tests of the
hardness of water, and the plan has the advantage of
being easily applied. With a test tube and a small
bottle of soap-solution, the investigator is ready at any
time or place to make tests; and a few minutes spent
over each specimen will give him an idea of the value
of the water for boiler purposes.</p>

<p>The original Clark soap-test was made with a soap-solution
of known strength, of which a certain measured
quantity was required to produce a permanent lather on
a gallon of water containing a given quantity of carbonate
of lime. The degrees of hardness of other specimens
were computed according to the quantity of the soap-solution
required to produce a permanent lather. Preparing
soap-solution of a certain strength, and water of
a certain hardness, for the purpose of indicating a point
for beginning the computations, is a tedious operation;
and the soap-test can be used in a much simpler way.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>370</span>
While making numerous tests of water on the Burlinglington,
Cedar Rapids, and Northern Railway some years
ago, to ascertain the condition of water tanks at different
seasons of the year, and in examining the supply of
proposed water stations on extensions of the road, I used
the following modification of the Clark <span class="locked">process:—</span></p>

<h3>MODIFICATION OF THE CLARK SOAP-TEST.</h3>

<p>The Cedar River, during its normal flow in summer,
contains about ten grains of solid matter, mostly calcium
carbonate, to the American gallon of 58,373 grains.
This I considered good boiler-water, and made it the
standard of comparison for my tests. Beside the shop,
there is a well, which the people who built the road dug
for supplying boiler-water; although the Cedar ran a few
rods distant. This well-water contained about forty
grains of solid matter to the gallon, one-fourth of the
impurity being sulphate of lime. This water I made
my “awful example” standard of comparison, so that
water approaching this in hardness was condemned.</p>

<p>The soap-solution I made by dissolving seventy grains
of castile soap, or white soap-powder, in a pint of alcohol.
Care must be taken that all the soap is dissolved,
and then it is best to keep the mixture in an even temperature
not below 60° Fahr. The tests can be made
more accurately by having the water under examination
brought to the same temperature as the soap-solution.</p>

<h3>APPLYING THE SOAP-TEST.</h3>

<p>In making the tests, a measured quantity of the Cedar
water was put into a stoppered bottle. One ounce of
water put into a two-ounce bottle is a convenient quantity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>371</span>
The soap-solution was then measured out with a
pipette made to hold thirty drops, and the bottle was
well shaken after each measure till it was found that a
lather was formed which held on for five minutes. The
operation was then repeated; and the last charge from
the pipette was put in, drop by drop, till the point where
a permanent lather formed was noted. A similar performance
was gone through with the bad well-water,
and very little practice enabled the operator to ascertain
where a specimen of water stood between the range of
the good and bad water.</p>

<p>The soap-solution must be kept in a properly stoppered
bottle; and, every time a new solution is made, its
strength must be tested in the above fashion. The
solution deteriorates when kept longer than a month or
six weeks.</p>

<p>The degree of turbidity caused by the first charge of
soap-solution, is an indication to the practiced experimenter
of the degree of hardness of the water.</p>

<p>Most men interested in ascertaining the condition
of boiler-water, can devise means for obtaining water of
known hardness wherewith to make comparative tests.</p>

<p>If water under examination prove very hard, the test
will be more accurately done by diluting it with its own
volume of distilled water.</p>

<p>The soap-test is good for lime in all its forms, and
magnesia; but the latter impurity uses up more soap
than lime does. So, where magnesia abounds in water,
the specimen under trial will seem harder than it actually
is. Magnesia is also slower than lime in acting
upon the soap. Water that contains magnesia will produce
a lather when enough solution is put in to overcome<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>372</span>
the lime present; but if it be allowed to stand a
few minutes, till the magnesia acts, the lather will not
then form. The presence of certain alkaline salts in
water, such as the carbonates and sulphates of soda and
potash, injuriously affects the soap-test by making the
water appear softer than it is; since they accelerate the
forming of a permanent lather. Keeping these facts in
mind will often prove of valuable service in making
tests of water.</p>

<p>When the soap-test indicates that water contains
hardening ingredients, representing more than fifteen
grains to the gallon, other tests should be at once made
to ascertain what the leading ingredients are.</p>

<h3>DIFFICULTIES OF PURIFYING WATER FOR LOCOMOTIVES.</h3>

<p>The nostrums offered to railroad managers for purifying
feed-water are legion, but it is doubtful if a single
remedy has proved entirely successful. In most instances,
the material or means used have been worthless
or impracticable; but, in other cases, the appliances
have not received justice from those attending their
application. Most people underrate the magnitude of
the task involved in undertaking to render the impurities
of feed-water innocent in locomotive boilers. The
case of a learned professor who undertook to doctor the
feed-water for locomotives on a prominent road, where
he made his arrangements for each engine using one
thousand gallons of water a day, is representative.
When provision has to be made for some engines using
double that quantity each hour, the difficulty of the
transaction becomes apparent. As has already been
said, I believe that obtaining soft surface-water is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>373</span>
proper way to avoid trouble with locomotive boilers;
but, where this is impracticable, considerable saving can
be effected by “doctoring” the water if the operations
are intelligently conducted.</p>

<h3>MUD.</h3>

<p>Mud is the most universal impurity of feed-water;
and, in many cases, it causes the destruction or injury
of sheets, particularly the crown-sheets of fire-boxes.
Where the water of a road is habitually muddy, it would
pay to filter the water, or to have two tanks at each
water station, so that a system could be followed of letting
the water settle in one tank while the other was in
use. The settled mud, by this means, could be washed
out regularly before a tank were refilled.</p>

<h3>CARBONATE OF LIME.</h3>

<p>Dr. Clark, inventor of the soap-test, recommended a
method of purifying water containing carbonate of lime,
which has been successfully followed in many places,
especially in England. It consists of adding caustic
lime to water containing carbonate of lime. By this
process, 28 grains of caustic lime result in the precipitation
of 100 grains of lime carbonate. Or, to put it in a
practical shape, where a tank contains 30,000 gallons of
water, each gallon being impregnated with 30 grains of
lime carbonate, 36 pounds of caustic lime will be sufficient
to precipitate the whole of the impurity, making a
total deposit of 164 pounds.</p>

<h3>SULPHATE OF LIME.</h3>

<p>Where the water impurity is principally sulphate of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>374</span>
lime, the caustic lime remedy will not work; but a precipitate
of the objectionable compound can be made by
treating the water with caustic baryta or caustic soda.
In the first case, the baryta takes possession of the sulphuric
acid holding the lime in solution, allowing the
latter to fall down as mud: when the soda cure is applied,
the sulphuric acid deserts the lime, and combines
with the soda, for which it has greater affinity, leaving
the lime to precipitate, unless it be preserved in solution
by the carbonic acid that accompanied the soda.</p>

<p>Where the water contains a mixture of lime sulphate
and carbonate, the soda treatment may be advantageously
used in combination with the caustic lime
system.</p>

<p>Attempts have frequently been made to purify water
by putting chemicals into the locomotive tenders, the
impurity being precipitated in the boiler. The leading
objection to this system is, that it leads to enormous
quantities of sediment being deposited inside the boiler;
since, in some instances, the purifying substance is as
bulky as the original impurity. In other cases, the
chemical introduced into the boiler causes foaming.
Let us take the case of water that contains fifteen
grains of sulphate of lime to the gallon, and is treated
with sulphate of baryta. To do so properly, one grain
of the chemical will be required for each grain of lime.
A freight engine uses seventy-five gallons of water to
the mile, and runs one hundred miles a day. This is
light service, both for water and mileage; yet, within
ten days, nearly three hundred pounds of solid matter is
injected into the boiler. To purify water by injecting
chemicals into locomotive boilers, and prevent the boiler<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>375</span>
filling up rapidly with mud, or giving trouble from foaming,
the blow-off cock and surface cock must be used so
frequently as to be felt on the consumption of coal.
Where purifying of feed-water <em>must</em> be done, the right
place to carry on the process is in the station tanks, or
in special appliances beside them. By carefully watching
the character of the impurities in the water, and
treating them with their proper precipitants, labor and
expense devoted to the purification of feed-water may
bring in good returns: where attempts are made to
improve the water over a whole road by one method of
treatment, failure is certain.</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>EXAMINATION FOR LOCOMOTIVE ENGINEERS.</i></span>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> following is the form of questions put to firemen
on one of the most prominent railroads in this country
before they are admitted as competent for promotion,
and the kind of answers expected from those who are considered
eligible for the higher position. The form questions
are not adhered to strictly, and care is taken that
a candidate for promotion does not commit the answers
to memory without properly understanding the subject.
No fireman is promoted who does not satisfy the examiner
that he understands the practical questions asked.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—What are the principal duties of an engineer
before attaching his engine to train?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—To examine the engine carefully, to see that all
set-screws are in place, and rod-keys secure; that the
engine is equipped with all necessary signals, firing, and
hand-tools; the necessary supply of water, fuel, and
stores. Also, to take a look at the flues and crown-sheet.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—What is important, in carrying water in the
boiler, as to height and regularity?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—To carry water and steam in the top gauge-cocks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>377</span>
when working steam, and as uniformly as possible.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—What is important in carrying water on grades,
and approaching a summit?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—To carry the water sufficiently high to be sure
that the front ends of the tubes are not exposed, and, in
pitching over a summit, to have sufficient water to cover
and protect the crown-sheet, after finding its level from
the front or low end of the boiler.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Should it be necessary, after pitching over a
summit, to pump up a gauge or more of water, what
should be the condition of the fire?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—The fire should be kept bright, and burning
freely.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Why is this important?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—To prevent chilling the flues, causing them to
leak.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Should you have ample water after pitching
over, what should be the condition of the fire?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—It should be leveled and settled down, and covered
over sufficiently to prevent unnecessary waste of
steam or fuel.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Should the pump or injectors fail on the road,
what would you do?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—First, smother down the fire, stop promptly,
take off the hose, and raise the tank-valves to ascertain
that they are connected; also see that the strainers
are clear. If all is found clear, then try the injectors
again; and, if the engine has a pump, take it down, and
see that the valves are free, and would also run water
through the feed-pipes. When all is open and free, put
them up, and try them again.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Should the water in the boiler get too low to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>378</span>
allow you time for the examination, what would
you do?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—Draw the fire, and send a messenger to the
nearest telegraph office for assistance.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Should the water in the boiler become disturbed,
and foam, what would you do? And how would
you ascertain whether it was foaming, or being over
pumped?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—As soon as the water is discovered discharging
from the stack, would at once shut off, and ascertain the
height of the water solid. Should the water drop below
the second or third gauge, would conclude there was
foaming, and would again gently open the throttle.
Should the water again rise, and discharge from the
stack, would put on both injectors, open the surface
blow, and run carefully; allowing the bad water to be
worked off through the surface blow, being very careful
not to work the water in sufficient quantities through
the cylinders as to endanger knocking out the heads;
and would occasionally shut off, to see that the water
was not being thrown off faster than the pumps or injectors
were supplying it. By this means, the bad water
would, in most cases, be worked out, and, with gentle
usage, would again settle.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Should the blow-off cock be blown out, or be
broken off, or a hole be broken in the boiler in any way,
what would you do?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—Draw the fire promptly, and send a messenger
to the nearest telegraph office for assistance. Would
then disconnect, and get the engine ready to be towed
in when assistance arrived.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—What portions of the engine would you disconnect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>379</span>
in such a case?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—Take off main rods and valve-rods.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—What is important to observe in setting up or
adjusting wedges?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—To have them so neatly adjusted that there will
be no thump of the boxes, and, at the same time, not so
tight as to cramp, and not allow them full and free play
in the pedestals.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—How would you go about setting them up?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—Would place the engine at half stroke on the
right side, block the left wheels, admit a little steam,
and thump the boxes hard away from the wedges.
Would then get under, and put the wedges up solid
with a short wrench, and make a side mark on the
pedestals at top of wedge, then draw them down
equally a scant one-eighth of an inch. Go over the left
side in the same manner.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—How would you key up, or adjust, the side rods
of a ten-wheel engine?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—Would place the engine on a level and straight
track, and on a dead center; then slack off all keys on
that line of rods; would then key the knuckle on center
brass first, leaving it sufficiently free on the pin to be
moved laterally by hand. Then adjust the front and
back ends in the same manner.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Why should you place the engine on exact
dead center, and begin by keying the center brass
first?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—In order to insure keying the rods of proper
length, to allow them to pass the dead, or rigid, points
without strain.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Can the side rods be keyed too long or too short<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>380</span>
when not standing on dead center?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—They can.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—If too long or too short, at what point of the
stroke will the strain be?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—While passing the dead, or rigid, points.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Should you slip the right back motion eccentric
on the road, how would you reset it?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—Would place the engine on exact dead center
on right side, place the reverse-lever in full forward
gear, and make a mark on the valve-rod at the stuffing-box
gland; then place the reverse-lever in full back
gear, and turn the slipped eccentric until the mark on
valve-rod came to its original position, being careful to
see that the full or throw of the eccentric was in position
nearly opposite the forward eccentric; then secure
it there.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—In what way does the mark you made on the
valve-rod, while in forward gear, aid you in setting the
slipped eccentric?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—The forward motion eccentric being in proper
position by placing the reverse-lever in full forward
gear, the valve is brought into proper position on the
ports; and the mark gives the position of the valve
when the back motion eccentric is in its proper position,
thus setting the slipped eccentric by the good
one.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Should a valve-yoke break, how would you test
in order to determine which side was disabled?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—Would first place the engine at half stroke on
right side, and admit a little steam to the cylinders;
then move the reverse-lever from back to forward motion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>381</span>
and, if the steam could be shifted from the back to
the forward cylinder-cock, would conclude that the right
yoke was good, and would test the left side in the same
way.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Why would you place your engine at half stroke
on the side you wished to test?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—In order to get the full movement of the valve
over the ports on that side.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—After locating the broken yoke, how would you
disconnect?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—Would take off the steam-chest lid, place the
valve over the ports, and block it there securely; replace
the lid, take off the valve-rod, take off the main
rod, block the cross-head, and proceed with half train,
if freight; if passenger, would take the full train to the
next telegraph office, report, and give judgment as to
whether the engine would take entire train to its destination.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Should you blow or break out a cylinder-head,
how would you disconnect?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—First, take off the valve-rod, and close the ports
with the valve, and secure it by cramping with the
stuffing-box gland; take off main rod, and block the
cross-head.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Should the cylinder packing drop and blow
badly on the road, how would you determine which side
was down?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—In starting from a station, would notice the
right cross-head, and, if the blow occurred when it was
leaving each extreme end of the stroke, would locate
the blow in the right cylinder.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Should it blow so badly as to make it necessary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>382</span>
to set it out on the road, what would be important for
you to observe in setting it out?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—Would be careful to set the piston central in
the cylinder, using calipers if at hand, and, if not, would
use a stick of proper length, and be careful only to set
the packing to fill the cylinder neatly, using as little
power on the bolts as practicable; lock the nuts securely,
and replace the follower, being careful to screw the
follower bolts home solid.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Should you be running an engine which had
but one pump, it being on the right side, and that side
became disabled, so that it would be necessary to disconnect
it, the injector be too small or fail to supply the
boiler, what would you do to avoid drawing the fire, and
being hauled home?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—Would disconnect the piston from the cross-head
on the disabled side, and take it out, put up the
main rod, and work the cross-head, which would give
the use of the pump.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Should you break the top rocker-arm, how would
you disconnect?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—Take off the valve-rod and broken arm, close
the ports, and secure the valve with the stuffing-box
gland, and disconnect, as in case of broken cylinder-head.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Should the bottom rocker-arm break, how would
you disconnect?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—As a rule, would not take off eccentric-straps;
but with an engine badly worn, and loose in link-hanger,
so that the link could play about freely when running,
would take off the eccentric-straps, and disconnect, as in
case of broken cylinder-head.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Should you break a link-hanger, how would you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>383</span>
disconnect?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—If but a short distance to run, and no stopping
or shifting to do, would run in without disconnecting,
after cautioning the crew to keep the train under good
control, and stop promptly when signaled to do so. But,
if a long distance to run, would disconnect, as in case
of broken cylinder-head.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—In what way would you have lost control of
your engine with broken link-hanger?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—Would only be able to reverse one side of the
engine.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Should you break an eccentric-strap, how would
you disconnect?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—Take off both eccentric-straps on that side, and
disconnect as in case of broken cylinder-head.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Should you break the back section of a side rod
on a six-wheel connected engine, what would you do?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—Would take off both back sections, and run in
with main and forward wheels connected, with about
two-thirds of train.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Should you break a forward section, how would
you disconnect?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—Would take off all side rods, and run in without
train.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Should you break a main crank-pin close up to
the wheel, how would you disconnect?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—Would take off all side rods and the main rod on
disabled side, and run in without train.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Should you be running an engine which had a
slide throttle-valve, and it would strip or disconnect
inside the boiler partly open, how would you manage?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—Would reduce the steam-pressure within easy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>384</span>
control, and state the trouble to the crew, and caution
them to act promptly when called upon to do so. Would
work the train, if freight, to the nearest siding, and back
it off; if passenger, would keep the pressure within easy
handling, and work the train to the nearest telegraph
office, report, and ask for orders.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Should one of the forward tires on a ten-wheel
engine break, how would you manage?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—Would jack the wheel up the thickness of the
tire, take out the oil-cellar, and cut a block to fit the
bottom of the box and journal sufficiently thick to hold
the axle up in its place when resting on the pedestal-brace;
would then run in without disconnecting, provided
the rod had not been bent or damaged by the
broken tire. Would take in full train.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Should you break a main tire, how would you
manage?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—Would first send messenger to nearest telegraph
office, and ask for assistance. Would then block up the
axle and wheel the thickness of the tire, slack off the
side-rod keys, and run in carefully without train.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i>—Should the back tire break, how would you
manage?</p>

<p><i>A.</i>—Would take off the back section of rods, block
up the axle, run very carefully, especially around curves,
to nearest telegraph office, report, and ask for orders.</p>
